<h2>
Multidimensional Indexing by R Trees and R<sup>+</sup> Trees
</h2>
</center>

The R/R<sup>+</sup> tree was originally designed to index geometric objects in the k-dimensional space
<b>R</b><sup>k</sup> spanned by the real numbers.
We generalize <b>R</b><sup>k</sup> to arbitrary Cartesian products 
S<sub>1</sub> &times; &middot;&middot;&middot; &times; S<sub>k</sub>
where each S<sub>i</sub> is linearly ordered.

<br><br>

Let S<sub>i</sub>, 1 &le; i &le; k, be sets where each S<sub>i</sub> is linearly ordered by
&lt;<sub>i</sub>, with x &le;<sub>i</sub> y abbreviating x &lt;<sub>i</sub> y or x = y.
A <i>k</i>-<i>dimensional box</i> in S<sub>1</sub> &times; &middot;&middot;&middot; &times; S<sub>k</sub> bounded by
a<sub>i</sub> &le;<sub>i</sub> b<sub>i</sub>, 1 &le; i &le; k, is the k-ary relation:
<blockquote>
{ &lang;x<sub>1</sub>, &hellip;, x<sub>k</sub>&rang; | 
a<sub>i</sub> &le;<sub>i</sub> x<sub>i</sub> &le;<sub>i</sub> b<sub>i</sub>, 
x<sub>i</sub> &isin; S<sub>i</sub>, 1 &le; i &le; k }.
</blockquote>
For any set (i.e. relation) P &subseteq; S<sub>1</sub> &times; &middot;&middot;&middot; &times; S<sub>k</sub>,
the <i>minimum bounding box</i> of P, denoted MBB(P), is the smallest k-dimensional box containing P.
We consider a collection of objects where each object is associated with a set
P &subseteq; S<sub>1</sub> &times; &middot;&middot;&middot; &times; S<sub>k</sub>
and indexed by MBB(P).
R/R<sup>+</sup> trees allow efficient search for objects whose MBB(P) is equal to a given box B, but also
contains, intersects, or is contained in B.

<br><br>

An example of non-geometric object is a binary relation Observation(Patient, Symptom), which
can be modeled by a relation class <i>Observation</i>.
An <i>Observation</i> object instance for patient <i>p</i> exhibiting symptom <i>s</i> may be associated with 
the relation:

<br><br>

P = { &lang;<i>b</i>, <i>h</i>, <i>d</i>, <i>a</i>&rang; | blood pressure <i>b</i>, heartbeat <i>h</i> were observed on date <i>d</i> at age <i>a</i> }

<br><br>

The <i>Observation</i> object can be indexed by MBB(P).

<br><br>

Another example is bank customers indexed by the relation:

<br><br>

P = { &lang;<i>b<sub>1</sub></i>, &hellip;, <i>b<sub>n</sub></i>, <i>i</i>, <i>a</i>&rang; | the customer had balances <i>b<sub>1</sub></i>, &hellip;, <i>b<sub>n</sub></i> in <i>n</i> accounts, income <i>i</i>, at age <i>a</i> }

<br><br>

<b>R trees</b> have the following properties:

<ul>
<li>
Each node is a page/block of a secondary storage.
<li>
Each node contains <i>n</i> entries of (m<sub>i</sub>, p<sub>i</sub>), 1 &le; i &le; <i>n</i>, where m<sub>i</sub> is
a (representation of) k-dimensional box and p<sub>i</sub> is a pointer.
The value of <i>n</i> must satisfy N<sub>1</sub> &le; <i>n</i> &le; N<sub>2</sub> for some constants N<sub>1</sub>, N<sub>2</sub>
such that 0 &lt; N<sub>1</sub> &le; N<sub>2</sub>/2.
<li>
In the non-leaf nodes, p<sub>i</sub> points to a child node and
m<sub>i</sub> is the MBB of the union of all MBBs in that child node.
<li>
In the leaf nodes, p<sub>i</sub> points to an object associated with a set P such that
MBB(P) = m<sub>i</sub>, or to a bucket of objects associated with sets whose MBBs are all m<sub>i</sub>.
<li>
All leaf nodes are at the same depth.
</ul>

It can be shown that any R trees of height h containing M entries in total in the leaf nodes
satisfy:
<blockquote>
N<sub>1</sub><sup>h+1</sup> &le; M &le; N<sub>2</sub><sup>h+1</sup>, i.e.,
<br>
log<sub>N<sub>2</sub></sub>M &minus; 1 &le; h &le; log<sub>N<sub>1</sub></sub>M &minus; 1 (unless N<sub>1</sub> = 1)
</blockquote>

guaranteeing h = &Theta;(log M).

<br><br>

<b>Search Procedure</b>
To search for objects related to a given box, B, start from the root and follow a path or paths determined by
containment/intersection relation between B and index MBBs m<sub>i</sub>.

<ul>
<li>Find objects whose MBB is equal to B:
  <br><br>
  <ol>
  <li>In a non-leaf node, find the m<sub>i</sub>'s with B &subseteq; m<sub>i</sub>, and
      follow the associated pointers p<sub>i</sub>'s.
  <li>In a leaf node, find the m<sub>i</sub> with B = m<sub>i</sub>.
  </ol>
  <br>
<li>Find objects whose MBBs contain B:
  <br><br>
  <ol>
  <li>In any node, find the m<sub>i</sub>'s with B &subseteq; m<sub>i</sub>, and
      follow the associated pointers p<sub>i</sub>'s.
  </ol>
  <br>
<li>Find objects whose MBBs intersect B:
  <br><br>
  <ol>
  <li>In any node, find the m<sub>i</sub>'s with B &cap; m<sub>i</sub> &ne; &empty;, and
      follow the associated pointers p<sub>i</sub>'s.
  </ol>
  <br>
<li>Find objects whose MBBs are contained in B:
  <br><br>
  <ol>
  <li>In a non-leaf node, find the m<sub>i</sub>'s with B &cap; m<sub>i</sub> &ne; &empty;, and
      follow the associated pointers p<sub>i</sub>'s.
  <li>In a leaf node, find the m<sub>i</sub>'s with m<sub>i</sub> &subseteq; B.
  </ol>
</ul>

In general, all the four search procedures above may need to search multiple paths since
MBBs in non-leaf nodes may overlap.

<br><br>

<b>R<sup>+</sup> trees</b> are similar to R trees except having the following properties:

<ul>
<li>
The MBBs contained in the non-leaf nodes at the same level do not overlap.
<li>
At the next-to-last level (i.e., the parent-level of the leaf nodes),
m<sub>i</sub>'s need not be MBBs, but
the MBB of all the m<sub>i</sub> contains all MBBs of the subtrees.
<li>
Each object entry (m<sub>i</sub>, p<sub>i</sub>) is included in every leaf node pointed by
a parent entry (m<sub>i</sub>', p<sub>i</sub>') such that m<sub>i</sub> and m<sub>i</sub>' intersect.
</ul>

<b>Search Procedure</b>

<ul>
<li>Find objects whose MBB is equal to B:
  <br><br>
  <ol>
  <li>In a non-leaf node, find the first m<sub>i</sub> intersecting B, and
      follow the associated pointer p<sub>i</sub>.
  <li>In a leaf node, find the m<sub>i</sub> with B = m<sub>i</sub>.
  </ol>
  <br>
  <b>The search path is unique</b>.
  <br><br>
<li>Find objects whose MBBs contain B:
  <br><br>
  <ol>
  <li>In a non-leaf node, find the first m<sub>i</sub> intersecting B, and
      follow the associated pointer p<sub>i</sub>.
  <li>In a leaf node, find the m<sub>i</sub>'s with B &subseteq; m<sub>i</sub>.
  </ol>
  <br>
  <b>The search path is unique</b>.
  <br><br>
<li>Find objects whose MBBs intersect B:
    Same as R trees. Search paths may not be unique.
    <br><br>
<li>Find objects whose MBBs are contained in B:
    Same as R trees. Search paths may not be unique.
</ul>
