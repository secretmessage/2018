Midterm Exam Review Notes
</title>

This page lists the most important materials likely to be involved in midterm exam questions, along with some tips.
They should help your preparation, but only studying from these notes does not guarantee you will pass the exam.
A calculator will not be needed in the exam.

<ul>
<li>
Course Notes #1
  <br><br>
  <ul>
  <li>
  Comparison and characteristics of relational DBs, object-oriented DBs, object-relational DBs.
  How entity sets, hierarchical (nested) entity sets, and relations are represented in each of these three DB
  paradigms.  
  <li>
  You should be able to point out at least two comparative pros and cons of relational DBs and
  object-oriented DBs.
  <li>
  Three kinds of languages associated with DB systems:
  data definition languages, data manipulation languages (including query languages), application development languages.
  <li>
  Three types of OODB systems organizations:
  transparent persistent object store systems,
  object-relational mapping systems,
  autonomous object store systems.
  Understand the conceptual organization of each and differences.
  </ul>
  <br>

<li>
Formalism of Relations (Course Notes #2)
  <br><br>
  <ul>
  <li>
  The definitions of Cartesian products and relations.
  <li>
  The definitions and intuitive import of inverses and compositions of binary relations.
  Study the examples included in the notes.
  <li>
  The definition of projection of n-ary relations, by constant objects, existential quantifications, and both.
  Study the examples included in the notes.
  <li>
  Given a simple block/UML diagram of classes and binary/n-ary relations,
  you should be able to define a given relation or set, described in English, using
  the inverse, composition, and/or projection operation.
  </ul>
  <br>

<li>
Modeling Classes and Inheritance Hierarchies in UML (Course Notes #3)
  <br><br>
  <ul>
  <li>
  UML notations of class boxes and inheritance.
  <li>
  Difference between instance and static features.
  <li>
  Difference between single and multiple inheritance.
  <li>
  Abstract classes &ndash; what they are and why they are useful.
  <li>
  Criteria for creating subclasses &ndash;
  importance of relevance of criteria to application domains.
  <li>
  Algorithm to build inheritance hierarchies.
  Given a small set of class numbers and their feature sets,
  you should be able to apply the algorithm and build its inheritance hierarchy. 
  </ul>
  <br>

<li>
Modeling Relations in UML (Course Notes #4)
  <br><br>
  <ul>
  <li>
  Two types of binary relations:
  association and whole-part.
  <li>
  Multiplicities of binary relations.
  <li>
  Two types of whole-part relations:
  composition (strong composition) and
  aggregation (weak composition).
  What are the requirements of strong composition?
  What is the difference between strong and weak composition?
  Study the examples included in the notes.
  <li>
  Recursive whole-part relations.
  Study the examples in the notes.
  <li>
  Modeling n-ary relations by relation classes.
  <li>
  Tuple model vs aggregation model of relations.
  What is the advantage of aggregation model?
  <li>
  Benefits of using relation classes to model binary relations.
  Study the examples in the notes.
  <li>
  Modeling symmetric binary relations.
  Study the examples in the notes.
  <li>
  Modeling directed and undirected networks.
  </ul>
  <br>

<li>
Course Notes #5
  <br><br>
  <ul>
  <li>
  Mapping class diagrams to class schemas.
  Given a small class diagram, you should be able to map it to Java-like class schemas of
  fields of class types or Set&lang;C&rang; types.
  <li>
  The definition of a key of a class.
  A key using extended attributes.
  <li>
  Inter-part local relations and hierarchical decomposition.
  The definition and intuitive import of inter-part local relations.
  Study the examples in the notes.
  <li>
  Given an all-in-one class diagram, you should be able to show hierarchical decomposition of it
  using the method described in the notes. 
  </ul>
  <br>
