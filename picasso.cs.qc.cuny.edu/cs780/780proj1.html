PROJECT 1: Modeling Objects in Bank Database
</b>
<br>

Due: 03/13/18, Tuesday, 11 PM

<br><br>

In this semester you are to design and model
a bank database pertaining to customers and banking transactions.
Information internal to banks and irrelevant to customers and transactions will be omitted,
like information about internal office structures and employees. 
The objective of Project 1 is to model the following basic objects:

<ul>
<li>
accounts (e.g., savings accounts, checking accounts, credit card accounts, loan accounts)
<li>
account holders
<li>
branches
<li>
terminals: objects used to initiate and conduct transactions
(e.g., bank websites, ATMs, credit/debit card scanners, mobile devices, user interfaces within bank intranets)
<li>
paper checks and credit/debit cards issued to account holders
</ul>

These objects must be modeled by a UML class diagram.

<ul>
<li>
Use <b>generalization-specialization (inheritance) hierarchies</b> effectively.
For example, different types of accounts should be organized by an inheritance hierarchy,
with the most general account class at the root.
<li>
Use <b>weak/strong composition whole-part hierarchies</b> effectively.
For example, branches have terminals like ATMs, card scanners at the counter, and intranet user interfaces used by clerks.
</ul>

Additional objects and association relations, including banking transactions, will be modeled in Project 2 and 
should not be included in this project.

<br><br>

In this course, there is no need to design/implement algorithms or functions. Rather, your task is to design a well-structured database model on which necessary algorithms and functions can be implemented and added.

<br><br>

Feel free to build a model patterned after the bank(s) you deal with.
If you have no bank account, and even if you do,
you are encouraged to visit a few bank websites for "field research".
Keep in mind, however, that structures of websites do not necessarily translate into good database models.
Certain structural aspects of websites are influenced by human user interface issues
(e.g., ease and efficiency of the user's reading and navigation) that are largely irrelevant to
internal database models.
</p>

Here is a summary of key points:

<ul>
<li>
All the classes, inheritance hierarchies, whole-part hierarchies
must be modeled in a UML class diagram. 
The multiplicity ranges of each whole-part relation must be specified.
<li>
Include basic, essential attributes in classes.
Attribute data types may be specified or omitted in this project.
<li>
Make classes <i>abstract</i> if you are certain they will not have any direct objects.
<li>
Key attributes, if any, should be specified by appending <i>(key)</i> to the attribute names.
For example, if an account class has a key attribute <i>accountNum</i>,
designate it by <i>accountNum (key)</i>.
<li>
If attribute/relation names are not self-explanatory, concisely describe their intended semantics by English comments in the text documentation area.
Your UML tool should provide text documentation areas/boxes for this purpose.
<li>
Use the following identifier convention consistently:
Class names should begin with uppercase letters; if a class name is a noun, it should be in singular form.
Attribute and relation names should generally begin with lowercase letters.
<li>
Consider using different background colors of class boxes for different groups of classes.
For example, you might use <b><font color=#ADD8E6>light blue</font></b> for the group of classes involving
accounts,
<b><font color=#5EFB6E>light green</font></b> for the group of classes involving branches, etc.
Use light colors to prevent text strings from getting buried in dark colors.
</ul>

The projects must be completed by a UML tool.
If you've never used a UML tool,
<a href = "http://www.visual-paradigm.com/download/community.jsp">Visual Paradigm UML free community edition</a>
is recommended.

<b>Submission</b>
<ul>
<li>
If you've used Visual Paradigm,
email to keitaro.yukawa@gmail.com your Visual Paradigm project file (the one with .vpp extension), using
the subject header:
<br><br>
CS 332 (or CS 780), Project 1, Your Full Name(s)
<br><br>
<li>
If you've used some other UML tool, please speak to me personally to discuss what to hand in.
</ul>

Groups of two students should submit only one project, but include both students' names in the email header.
