<b>Prerequisites</b> 
<br><br>
For CS 332: CS 331 Database Systems
<br>
For CS 780: Completion of all conditional courses and
a course equivalent to CS 331 Database Systems
<br><br>
A working knowledge of JAVA is required
for both CS 332 and CS 780.
<br><br>
<b>Grading Scheme</b>
<ul>
<li>
Midterm Exam: 35%
<li>
Final Exam: 35%
<br>
The final exam will NOT be cumulative;
each of the two examinations will cover about 
a half of the entire course material.
<li>
Four Projects: 30% (7.5% each)
<br>
The student will design, model, and implement a substantial object-oriented database.
Modeling will be done in
<a href="http://www.uml.org">Unified Modeling Language</a> and
implementation will be done in 
<!--
the
<a href="http://www.objectdb.com">ObjectDB</a> realization of the
-->
<a href="http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/index-jsp-135919.html">Java Data Objects</a>.
</ul>

There will be four course projects.
In the first three projects, you will design, model, and implement object-oriented databases.
You may complete the first three projects <b>individually or by a group of two</b>.
If you work in a group of two, <b>you and the same partner must complete all of the first three projects</b>;
you are not permitted to change the partner and not permitted to get together or separated after Project 1.
A CS 332 student and a CS 780 student are not permitted to form a group.
Both students in each group will receive the same grades.
Of course, working on any projects in groups and then submitting (modifications of) them as individual work is not 
permitted and will automatically receive an F grade.
A higher grading standard will be applied to groups of two and CS 780 students.
The highest standard will apply to groups of two CS 780 students.
The middle standard will be used for groups of two CS 332 students and for individual CS 780 students.
The most lenient standard will be used for individual CS 332 students. 
In this regard, a one-letter-grade differential guideline will be used.
For example,
projects of about equal quality might receive a B if done by two CS 332 students 
or by a single CS 780 student, and a B+ if done by a single CS 332 student, and
a B&minus; if done by two CS 780 students.
Every individual or group can get an A, but a project done by two CS 780 students will have to be of exceptional
quality to get an A.

<br><br>

The fourth project will be a set of exercises in query composition and <b>must be completed individually</b> with no exception.
