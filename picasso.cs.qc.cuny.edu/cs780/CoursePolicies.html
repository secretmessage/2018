<p>
The midterm and final examinations in this course
must be completed <b>individually and independently</b>. 
Cheating of any form will be handled 
according to the Queens College academic regulations.
</p>

<p>
During examinations, no one is to leave the room before
handing in the answer booklets and the exam papers.
Be sure to use a rest room before examinations.
All electronic devices and watches must be stowed away in invisible places, and
cell phones must be set on silent mode.
</p>

<p>
You must take the scheduled exams even if
you should suffer from mild cases of sickness or injury
(flu, headache, etc.). Makeup exams will be granted
<b>only if</b>  written documents (such as a doctor's statement)
are submitted to prove that <b>highly abnormal</b>  events have
prevented you from taking the exam &ndash; in this case,
you must notify me by email <b>before</b>  the exam explaining
exactly why you cannot take the exam and when a document of
proof will be submitted.
</p>

<p>
The course grades of all students will be determined by their grades in the midterm exam, final exam, and regularly assigned course projects.
No student will be given, under any circumstance, any sort of "extra work" for grade inflation such as additional exams, assignments, or projects.
</p>

<p>
The final examination will be held according to the schedule posted on CUNYfirst.
