A Geometric Model of a Meteorologic Database

Description
</b>

The foundation of this meteorologic database model is the class
<i>Graph</i>.
Each graph consists of nodes and edges, and represents a geometric shape
on the earth's surface.
A node is represented by (latitude, longitude).
An edge represents a "straight line" between two nodes.
A "straight line" could be a straight line on a 2-dimensional Euclidean plane
or a geodesic on the earth's surface.
Curved lines are approximated by series of sufficiently short straight lines.
It is assumed that a host of computational geometry algorithms to compute
spatial relations among geometric objects are implemented within the classes
<i>Graph</i>, <i>Node</i>, <i>Node-3D</i>, <i>Edge</i>.
This collection of classes is the world of pure geometry.

<br><br>

From the above geometric classes, the following five types of objects are derived
by inheritance.

<ul>
<li>
<i>DataNode</i>: Represents a location where meteorologic data was collected.
<li>
<i>GeologicObject</i>: Geologic objects divided into water and land objects.
Some land objects are associated with sets of 3-dimensional nodes
to be used for triangulated irregular network (TIN) rendering and analysis.
<li>
<i>GovernmentalObject</i>:
The class of governmental, political units.
<li>
<i>AtmosphericObject</i>:
The class of atmospheric objects divided into air pressure lines,
fronts, and cloud regions.
<li>
<i>Zone</i>:
Industrial, agricultural, and residential zones.
</ul>

Certain spatial relations are explicitly provided between geologic/governmental
objects for the sake of efficiency, so that they can be retrieved from
the database rather than computed by computational geometry algorithms.
