Exercise Set #2
<br><br>


<b>1.</b> Concisely explain the difference between <em>abstract</em> and <em>concrete</em> classes.

<br><br>

<b>2.</b> Consider the following simplified model of an "airline company database". 

<pre>

  class Flight               class Airplane          class CrewMember       class Airport
  { attributes               { attributes            { attributes           { attributes
      flight #                   ID #                    ID #                   name
      departure time             model name              name                   code
      arrival time               capacity                age                }
  }                              max flight time     }
                             }
                                                        
  class Pilot extends CrewMember       class Attendant extends CrewMember
  { attributes                          { attributes
      rank                                  position
      experience in # of years          }
  }                                                           

</pre>

<b>Association Relations</b>

<br><br>

<b>Note</b>: 
R: C &rarr; D  &nbsp; a..b, c..d &nbsp; means R is a binary relation from class C to class D. 
The multiplicity range a..b is for C's side and c..d is for D's side.

<br><br>

from: Flight &rarr; Airport &nbsp;  1..*, 1  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
from( f, a ): flight <i>f</i> departs from airport <i>a</i>
<br>
to: Flight &rarr; Airport &nbsp;  1..*, 1  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
to( f, a ): flight <i>f</i> arrives to airport <i>a</i>
<br>
assignedTo: CrewMember &rarr; Flight &nbsp;  1..10, 1..3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
assignedTo( c, f ): crew member <i>c</i> is assigned to flight <i>f</i>
<br>
canUse: Flight &rarr; Airplane &nbsp;  1..*, 1..*  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
canUse( f , a ): flight <i>f</i> can use airplane <i>a</i>
<br>
canOperate: Pilot &rarr; Airplane &nbsp;  2..*, 1..*   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
canOperate( p, a ): pilot <i>p</i> can operate airplane <i>a</i>

<ol>  
<li>Give a UML diagram for this database model (you need not include attributes).
<li>Which class could be abstract in this model?
<li>Give Java-like class definitions for this database; choose appropriate data types for the attributes and relations.
As discussed in class, use Set&lt;<i>C</i>&gt; type, where <i>C</i> is a suitable class,
to implement relations with multiplicities higher than 1.   
<li>The relation <i>assignedTo</i> has multiplicities 1..10, 1..3. Explain precisely what they mean.
<li>Is it reasonable to change the multiplicities of <i>assignedTo</i> to 1, 1..3? Explain your answer.

  class Book extends Item       class CD extends Item
  { attributes                  { attributes
      authors                       musicians
  }                             }

</pre>

<b>Association Relations</b>

<br><br>

<ol>
<li>Give a UML diagram for this database model (you need not include attributes).
<li>Give Java-like class definitions for this database; choose appropriate data types for
    the attributes and relations.

</ol>
  
<b>4.</b>

<ol>
<li>The building model in &sect;1.
<li>The binary tree model in &sect;1.
<li>The text block model in &sect;1.
<li>The directed and undirected network model in &sect;3.

</ol>

<ol>
<li>Give a definition of a <em>key</em> for a class.
<li>Describe the difference between keys and indexes.
</ol>

<b>6.</b> Consider the 3-ary relation Contract( Author, Publisher, Book ) among the classes 
    Author, Publisher, and Book. 
    Contract( <i>a</i>, <i>p</i>, <i>b</i> ) means that author <i>a</i> signed a contract with
    publisher <i>p</i> to write book <i>b</i>. 

<ol>
<li>Give a UML diagram for a <i>tuple model</i> of the Contract relation. 
    Include all necessary relations and their multiplicities. 
    Also, choose two or three suitable attributes in each class and then implement your UML model in Java.
<li>Do Question (a) using an <i>aggregate model</i> of Contract instead of a tuple model.
<li>What advantage does the aggregate model have over the tuple model?
</ol>

<b>7.</b> Consider the 4-ary relation Take(Student, Course, Program, Grade) among the four classes
    Student, Course, Program, and Grade. 
    Take(<i>s</i>, <i>c</i>, <i>p</i>, <i>g</i>) means student <i>s</i> took course <i>c</i> in program <i>p</i> and
    received grade <i>g</i>. 
    Give a UML diagram for the Take relation. 
    Include all necessary relations and their multiplicities. 
    Also, choose two or three suitable attributes in each class and then implement your UML
    model in Java-like class definitions.

<br><br>

<b>11.</b> Consider the following binary relations pertaining to geographical objects. For each of

   or can be either.

<ol>
<li>Highways &ndash;  Interchanges
<li>States &ndash;  Cities
<li>States &ndash;  State Parks
<li>Roads &ndash;  Intersections
<li>Cities &ndash;  Airports

<b>12.</b>.
Consider a database of PCs to be used for an e-commerce site that specializes in selling PCs.
Based on the fact that the marketed PCs are manufactured by various companies, 
it has been proposed to create subclasses of PCs for different brands, 
like IBM-PC, DELL-PC, etc.
Is the creation of these classes justified?
Explain.
