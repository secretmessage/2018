PROJECT 2: Establishing Association Relations in Bank Database
</b>
<br>

Due: 04/08/18, Sunday, 11 PM

<br><br>

In the first phase of this project,
critically review your Project 1 model to detect flaws and shortcomings, including the corrections/comments/suggestions made in the grade report. Then remodel it to eliminate the problems.

<br><br>

In the second phase,
establish basic association relations among class objects modeled in Project 1.
In particular,
modeling of banking transactions will take a center stage in this project.
A banking transaction involves a transfer/exchange of funds among entities, usually between two entities,
along with other participating objects. Like contracts and tickets, banking transactions are best modeled by relation objects.

<br><br>

Incorporate banking transactions of the following types:
    
<ul>
    <li>
    cash withdrawals at ATMs and bank teller counters
    <li>
    cash deposits at ATMs and bank teller counters
    <li>
    electronic deposits/credits like salary deposits, interest credits, etc.
    <li>
    transfers between accounts of the same account holder
    <li>
    transactions involving paper checks deposited
    <li>
    transactions involving electronic checks
    <li>
    credit/debit card purchases
</ul>

Modeling the above transactions is a minimum requirement of this project.
To boost the project grade, you might also incorporate additional transactions like:

<ul>
    <li>
    external transfers between accounts of different account holders, possibly of different banks
    <li>
    payments (bill, loan, mortgage, etc.) 
</ul>
    
Create an abstract root class called <i>Transaction</i> and derive subclasses for different types of
transactions. The root <i>Transaction</i> class should have attributes/relations common to all transactions, like
the amount of money involved and the transaction time/date.
Every subclass should properly record the entities and terminals involved in transactions by
means of suitable relations.
These entities and terminals are important factors for differentiating subclasses.
For example, when a paper check you wrote is deposited, the following objects would be involved:

<ul>
    <li>check itself
    <li>checking account the check draws against
    <li>ATM/branch of the bank where the check is deposited
    <li>bank card used
    <li>payee account the money is moved to    
</ul>

When you purchase merchandise by a credit/debit card, the following objects would be involved:

<ul>
    <li>card used
    <li>credit/debit card account used
    <li>merchant
    <li>terminal used ("point of sale"), e.g., a card scanner at a store or a website of an online shop 
</ul>

If attribute/relation names are not self-explanatory, 
concisely describe their intended semantics by English comments in the text documentation area. 
Your UML tool should provide text documentation areas/boxes for this purpose.

<br><br>

<b>Submission</b>
<ul>
<li>
If you've used Visual Paradigm,
email to keitaro.yukawa@gmail.com your Visual Paradigm project file (the one with .vpp extension), using
the subject header:
<br><br>
CS 332 (or CS 780), Project 2, Your Full Name(s)
<br><br>
<li>
If you've used some other UML tool, email a legible graphic image of the model and documentation.
</ul>

Groups of two students should submit only one project, but include both students' names in the email header.

<br><br>

<b>NOTE:</b> 
Be reminded about the grade differentials and rules if you elect to 
<a href="grade.html">work in a group of two students</a>.
