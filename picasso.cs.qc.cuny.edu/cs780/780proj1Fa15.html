PROJECT 1: PC Database Model
</b>
<br>

Due: 10/15/15, Thursday, 11 PM

<br><br>

<b>Project Plan for the Semester</b>

<br><br>

In the first three projects, you will analyze, design, model, and implement 
a generic database of PC, personal computing devices, including desktops, laptops, tablets, and smartphones.
The database will include PCs' major hardware and software components that are
preinstalled or can be installed.

<br><br>

The main goal is to construct a clear, high-level, conceptual model of PCs and their components by means of effective inheritance and whole-part hierarchies together with pertinent association relations.
Once such a model is built, specific components should be derivable by suitable inheritance.
The projects will therefore model relatively significant hardware/software components to reasonable levels of
the specialization (inheritance) hierarchy,
but will not seek to include all components of actual PCs.

<br><br>

<b>Project 1 Description</b>

<br><br>

In Project 1, you are to establish a generalization-specialization (inheritance) hierarchy of
the following objects:

<ul>
<li>
products, both hardware and software; this will be the most general, root class of the hierarchy.
<li>
hardware products
<li>
PCs: desktops, laptops, tablets, smartphones
<li>
hardware components of PCs
<li>
processors: CPUs, GPUs
<li>
memories and storages: volatile, non-volatile
<li>
software products: operating systems, browsers, applications
</ul>

Each product object represents a product <i>model</i>,
not an individual hardware/software item with a serial number.

<br><br>
In addition, create a separate class of companies (which make products).
This class will be isolated in the Project 1 model.

<br><br>

Include appropriate attributes in classes.

<br><br>

Relations (association and whole-part) will be established in project 2, and should not be
included in this project.

<br><br>

Your model will be graded mainly on the soundness/effectiveness of the inheritance hierarchy,
and secondarily on the quality of class attributes.

<br><br>

Here is a summary of key points:

<ul>
<li>
All the classes and inheritance hierarchies
must be modeled in UML class diagrams. 
<li>
Include basic, essential attributes in classes.
Attribute data types may be specified or omitted in this project.
<li>
Key attributes, if any, should be specified by appending <i>(key)</i> to the attribute names.
For example, if the company class has a key attribute <i>companyName</i>,
put "<i>companyName (key)</i>" in the class box.
<li>
The intuitive semantics of class attributes should be concisely described by
English comments in the text documentation area,
unless their names are self-explanatory.
Your UML tool should provide text documentation areas for this purpose.
<li>
Use the following standard UML identifiers convention:
  <ul>
  <li>Class names should begin with uppercase letters; if a class name is a noun,
      it should be in singular form.
  <li>Relation names, class attributes, and function names should begin with
      lowercase letters.
  </ul>
</ul>

The projects must be completed by a UML tool.
If you've never used a UML tool,
<a href = "http://www.visual-paradigm.com/download/community.jsp">Visual Paradigm UML free community edition</a>
is recommended.

<br><br>

<b>Submission</b>
<ul>
<li>
If you've used Visual Paradigm,
email to yukawa.qc@optimum.net your Visual Paradigm project file (the one with .vpp extension), using
the subject header:
<br><br>
CS 332 (or CS 780), Project 1, Your Full Name(s)
<br><br>
<li>
If you've used some other UML tool, please speak to me personally to discuss what to hand in.
</ul>

Groups of two students should submit only one project, but include both students' names in the email header.

<br><br>

<b>NOTE:</b> 
Be reminded about the grade differentials and rules if you elect to 
<a href="grade.html">work in a group of two students</a>. 
In addition, a higher grading standard will be used for CS 780 students.
