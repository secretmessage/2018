Exercise Set #4

<br><br>

<b>1.</b> You are to model the classes <i>CrewMember</i>, <i>Pilot</i>, and <i>Attendant</i> 
given in Q2 of 
<a href="../Ex-2.html">Exercise Set #2</a>
by a composite structure without use of inheritance.

<ol>
<li>Give a UML diagram that models the three classes by a composite structure. 
    Include the headers of all necessary delegation functions.
<li>Implement the model in Java, including
    the delegation functions in the <i>Pilot</i> and <i>Attendant</i> classes. 
</ol>

<b>2.</b> Compare true inheritance and the composite-structure method for modeling specialization
hierarchies of classes (as discussed in Course Notes #6).
<ol>
<li>What is an advantage of the composite-structure method over true inheritance?
<li>What is an advantage of true inheritance over the composite-structure method? 
</ol>

<b>3.</b> You are to model the classes <i>Item</i>, <i>Book</i>, and <i>CD</i> 
given in Q3 of 
<a href="../Ex-2.html">Exercise Set #2</a>
by a composite structure without use of inheritance. 

<ol>
<li>Give a UML diagram that models the three classes by a composite structure. 
    Include the headers of all necessary delegation functions.
<li>Implement the model in Java, including
    the delegation functions in the <i>Book</i> and <i>CD</i> classes. 
</ol>

<b>4.</b>
The following is an inheritance tree of "gadgets".

<ol>
<li>
Remodel the inheritance tree to a composite structure using an abstract role class.
Include the headers of all necessary delegation functions.
<li>
Implement the model in Java, including
the delegation functions in the abstract role class. 
</ol>

<b>5.</b>
Describe a reasonable interpretation of valid time of objects in the following classes in
the college example:
Student, Take, Grade, Employee, Employment, Office, Course, CourseSection. 

<br><br>

<b>6.</b>
Consider this
<a href="../Ex-3/Ex-3-sol.html">example airline model</a>.
Describe a reasonable interpretation of valid time of objects in each of the classes.

<br><br>

<b>7.</b>
Consider the example college model.
Departments may update the credits, hours, and descriptions of courses they offer
while keeping their numbers and titles intact. 
Remodel the <i>Course</i> class to record the bitemporal histories of these three attributes,
and implement the remodeling in Java.

<!--
<b>8.</b>
The <i>TimePeriod</i> class has been used to record histories of class attribute values. 
In many cases, however, the time periods of an attribute history are contiguous in that 
the end time of every period (except the most recent one) is equal to the start time of the next period. 
In this case it is redundant and wasteful of storage space to record both start and end times. 
Give a model to record a contiguous attribute history without such redundancy.
-->

<br><br>

<b>8.</b>
In the example college model only the current chairperson is recorded by
the relation <i>chairPerson</i>: <i>Department</i> &rarr; <i>Professor</i>.
Remodel this relation to record the bitemporal history of all chairpersons of
every department, and implement the remodeling in Java.

<br><br>

<b>9.</b>
Consider the aggregate model of the Contract(Architect, Company, Building) relation described in
Course Notes #4.
Remodel the Contract class to incorporate its bitemporal history, and implement 
the remodeling in Java.

<br><br>

<b>10.</b>
In the following model of varsity teams, 
the roster spots are assumed to be the ones that currently exist, and
the <i>takenBy</i> relation only records which roster spots are being taken by which students
at the present time.

<center><img src="roster.jpg"></center>

<br>

However, roster spots may be added and deleted, and each roster spot may be taken
by different students at different times.
Remodel the above diagram to incorporate the bitemporal histories of roster spots and the <i>takenBy</i> relation, 
and implement the remodeling in Java.

<br><br>

<b>11.</b>
Consider the following scenario of a certain event's history
(tense is used relatively to the respective transaction times):

<br><br>

transaction time  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   fact and its valid time entered into database

<blockquote>
06/15/08: &nbsp; The event is scheduled to take place at site s<sub>1</sub> from 07/01/08 to 08/31/08.
<br>
06/25/08: &nbsp; The event's time schedule is changed to take place from 07/10/08 to 09/10/08.
<br>
08/10/08: &nbsp; The event was moved to site s<sub>2</sub> on 08/01/08; the time schedule remains the same.
<br>
09/01/08: &nbsp; The event's time schedule is extended to take place until 10/31/08.
<br>
09/15/08: &nbsp; The event is scheduled to move back to site s<sub>1</sub> on 10/01/08; the time schedule remains the same.
</blockquote>

<ol>
<li>
Give a bitemporal space displaying the bitemporal history of the event.
<li>
Give an object diagram representing the bitemporal history of the event.
</ol>
