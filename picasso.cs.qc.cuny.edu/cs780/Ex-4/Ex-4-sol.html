<ul>
<li>
Advantages of the composite-structure method over true inheritance:
 <ul>
 <li>The effect of inheritance can be simulated in DBs that do not support inheritance.
 <li>The effect of multiple inheritance can be simulated in OODBs that do not support multiple inheritance.
 <li>There is no potential combinatorial explosion in the # of subclasses that
     true multiple inheritance hierarchies could generate.
 </ul>
<li>
Advantages of true inheritance over the composite-structure method:
 <ul>
 <li>Automatic inheritance of features; no need to implement strong-composition relations
     and no need for delegation functions.
 <li>Inheritance polymorphism, i.e., dynamic binding of function code.
 </ul>
</ul>

The following are example answers.
There may be other good answers depending on specific contexts, purposes, and functions
of airline databases.

<ul>
<li>Airport
 <ul>
 <li>start: the time an airport opened
 <li>end: the time an airport closed
 </ul>
<li>Flight
 <ul>
 <li>start: the time a flight was introduced into the flight schedule 
 <li>end: the time a flight was removed from the flight schedule
 </ul>
<li>FlightInstance
 <ul>
 <li>start: the time reservations for a flight instance commenced
 <li>end: the time post-flight servicing for a flight instance was completed by mechanics 
 </ul>
<li>CanceledFlightInstance: the time cancellation became official; canceled date
<li>Airplane
 <ul>
 <li>start: the time an airplane was bought or rent by the airline company 
 <li>end: the time an airplane was sold, returned to the renter, scrapped, or destroyed by an accident
 </ul>
<li>Mechanic: the time period(s) of a mechanic's official employment
<li>CrewMember: the time period(s) of a crew member's official employment
<li>Passenger
 <ul>
 <li>one-time passenger
  <ul>
  <li>start: the time a reservation was made 
  <li>end: the arrival time of the flight instance the passenger was on, or
           the time a reservation was canceled
  </ul>
 <li>account holder (such as frequent-flier account)
  <ul>
  <li>start: the time an account was opened

<pre>
class Course
{
	String number;
	String title;
	Set&lt;Credits&gt; creditsHistory;
	Set&lt;Hours&gt; hoursHistory;
	Set&lt;Description&gt; descriptionHistory;
}

Instead of Set, TreeSet or LinkedList may be used to maintain histories sorted in
chronological or reverse chronological order.

class Credits
{
	int credits;
	Set&lt;BitemporalCell&gt; bitemporalCells;
}

Similarly for the Hours and Description classes.

class BitemporalCell
{
	TimePeriod validTime;
	TimePeriod transactionTime;
}
</pre>

Each A-object records only the start of its valid and transaction times;
the end times are equal to the start times of the next A-object in the chronologically sorted list.
The end times of the most recent A-object are recorded in the <i>class attributes</i>
<tt>validTimeEndLatest</tt> and <tt>transactionTimeEndLatest</tt> as just one value of each is needed
for the entire class.
It is assumed that the chronological order with respect to
the valid times is identical to that with respect to the transaction times
(but the start times or the time periods may differ).

<br>

This is a 2-tuple model of chairperson using the relation class Chair:
Each Chair-object represents a tuple &lang;<i>d</i>, <i>p</i>&rang;
meaning professor <i>p</i> was or has been the chairperson of
department <i>d</i>, with each tuple associated to its bitemporal history.

<pre>
class Chair
{
	Department department;
	Professor professor;
	Set&lt;BitemporalCell&gt; bitemporalCells;
}
</pre>

Department class might have a filed of Set&lt;Chair&gt; type
implementing the inverse relation of <i>department</i> to access the chair data efficiently.
Professor class might also have a filed of Set&lt;Chair&gt; type, but it would not be useful for
most purposes since most professors have never been chairs and efficient retrieval of
a professor's chair data is not a common or frequent query.

<pre>
class Contract
{
	Set&lt;Architect&gt; architects;
	Set&lt;Company&gt; companies;
	Set&lt;Building&gt; buildings;
	Set&lt;BitemporalCell&gt; bitemporalCells;
}
</pre>

Architect, Company, Building classes might have fields of Set&lt;Contract&gt; type
implementing the inverse relations of
<i>architects</i>, <i>companies</i>, <i>buildings</i>, respectively.
