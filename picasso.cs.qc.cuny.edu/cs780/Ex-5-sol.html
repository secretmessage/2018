Exercise Set #5 Solutions

<font face="verdana" size=-1>

<b>Exercise 1</b>.

The following query retrieves all students each of whom has at least two other students
with the same last name:

<br><br>

Unbound variables: s2: Student, s3: Student

</font>

<pre>
{ s1: Student | s1.name.lastName == s2.name.lastName &&
                s2.name.lastName == s3.name.lastName &&
                s1 != s2 && s2 != s3 && s3 != s1  }
</pre>

<font face="verdana" size=-1>

<ol>
<li>
 What would be the result of the query if the condition "s1 != s2" were omitted?
 What if "s2 != s3" or "s3 != s1" were omitted?
</font>
 <br>
 <font color=blue>
 In each of the three cases the result would be the collection of all students each of whom has at least one
 other student with the same last name.
 If "s1 != s2" were omitted, &exist;s2:Student (s1.name.lastName == s2.name.lastName) is trivially
 satisfied by choosing s2 == s1, hence the logical meaning of the query reduces to:
 <pre>
 { s1: Student | &exist;s3:Student
                 (s1.name.lastName == s3.name.lastName &&
                  s1 != s3 && s3 != s1)  }
 </pre>
 Likewise for the other two cases.
 </font>
<font face="verdana" size=-1>
<li>
 What would be the result of the query if the condition "s1 != s2 && s2 != s3" were omitted?
</font>
 <br>
 <font color=blue>
 The result would be identical to the one for the above question.
 The reason is that
 s2 and s3 can be chosen so that s1 == s2 or s2 == s3 but not both due to the remaining condition s3 != s1.

</ol>

<b>Exercise 2</b>.

Consider the following JDO class definitions.

</font>

<pre>
Class Book                                   Class Publisher
{ String title;                              { String name; // key attribute 
  HashSet&lt;Author&gt; writtenBy;                   HashSet&lt;Book&gt; published;
  Publisher publishedBy;                     }
    // the inverse of Publisher.published
}

Class Author
{ String authorID; // key attribute
  HashSet&lt;Book&gt; wrote; // the inverse of Book.writtenBy
}
</pre>

<font face="verdana" size=-1>

Note: The relation "an author wrote a book" includes cases where
an author co-wrote a book with other authors; likewise for the inverse
relation <i>writtenBy</i>.

<br><br>

For each of the following descriptions of queries pertaining to the above
classes, give a JDOQL query in set form.
If necessary, use suitable bound and/or unbound variables, and specify
the bound/unbound variables used along with their types;
also, give the logical interpretation of the query using existential quantifiers.

<br><br>

<b>1.</b>

Result: the author whose authorID is equal to <i>ID</i>

</font>

<b>10.</b> <b>(Relatively Difficult)</b>
Can the following parametric query be expressed by a single JDOQL query in set form?
If not, explain why.
<br><br>
Parameter: x: int
<br>
Result: all authors that wrote at least <i>x</i> books published by Academic Press

<br><br>
</font>
<font color=blue>
To express this in a single JDOQL query, it would need to generate <i>x</i> bound variables of Book type
for any given value of the parameter <i>x</i>, or use an existential variable of type HashSet&lt;Book&gt; searching for
a set of at least <i>x</i> books published by Academic Press associated with an author.
JDOQL supports neither feature, so the answer seems to be in the negative.

<b>11.</b>
Result: all books <i>b</i> such that <i>b</i>'s authors include one who wrote
a book titled "Database Systems"

<br><br>

<b>12.</b>
Result: all authors that co-wrote at least one book with
one or more other authors

<br><br>

<b>13.</b>
Result: all authors that co-wrote at least one book with two or more other authors

</font>
<font color=blue>
<pre>
Bound variable: b: Book
{ a: Author | a.wrote.contains(b) && b.writtenBy.size() >= 3 }

{ a: Author | &exist;b:a.wrote (b.writtenBy.size() >= 3) }
</pre>
</font>
<font face="verdana" size=-1>

<b>14.</b>
Parameter: pname: String
<br>
Result: the publisher whose name is equal to <i>pname</i>

<br><br>

<b>15.</b>
Parameter: x: int
<br>
Result: all publishers that published at least <i>x</i> books

<br><br>

<b>16.</b>
Parameter: authorID: String
<br>
Result: all publishers that published at least one book written by <i>authorID</i>

<br><br>

<b>17.</b>
Parameter: x: int
<br>
Result: all publishers that published only books that were each written by
fewer than or equal to <i>x</i> authors.

</font>
<font color=blue>
<pre>
Bound variable: b: Book
{ p: Publisher | !(p.published.contains(b) && b.writtenBy.size() > x) }

<b>Exercise 5</b>.

Give JDOQL queries in set form to retrieve each of the following.

Get all customers that placed an order that includes the item with itemID = "123".

Get all customers that placed an order that includes at least five items.

Get all customers that have ordered at least two different items, not necessarily in one order.

Get all customers that have placed at least one order and have only ordered the item with itemID = "123"
