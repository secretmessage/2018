Please inform your students the need to check their QC-assigned email account, which is the default email destination used by the College for announcements and notifications.  
Even if they have their preferred email address recorded in CUNYfirst, 
certain messages may still go to their QC-assigned email account.

Please also let CS majors and CS graduate students know that if they have not received any email announcement from the department in recent weeks, they should
contact Ms. Xiuyi Huang to make sure that they have the right email address on our mailing list so they can be informed of any important departmental news,
job/internship/research opportunities, etc.
