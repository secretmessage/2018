To build JDO/ObjectDB databases, you need two things:

<ul>
<li>
 <a href="http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html">
 Java JDK 5.0 or higher</a>.
 You may instead use any Java development kit compatible with 
 JDK 5.0 or higher &ndash; make sure it supports
 generic class types.
<li>
 <a href="http://www.objectdb.com/object/db/database/download">ObjectDB</a>.
 Just unzip the downloaded file to a folder, say c:\Program Files\objectdb.
 There is no installation wizard and such to run.
</ul>

ObjectDB is entirely implemented in Java, so you need to set environment variables in the usual way.
Specifically, make sure that

<ul>
<li>
 The <b>path</b> environment variable is set to include the <em>bin</em>
 folder of the Java JDK.
 <!--
 (If you already have an older version of JDK on your computer
 and have just installed the latest version,
 we suggest deleting the old version's path name from the path environment variable.)
 -->
 You can check the active version number by the command:
 <br><br>

 java  &minus;version
 <br><br>
 It should display the current version number you're using.
<li>
 The <b>classpath</b> environment variable is set to include:
 <br><br>
 c:\Program Files\objectdb\bin\objectdb.jar
 <br><br>
 Here we're assuming you've installed ObjectDB in the folder:
 c:\Program Files\objectdb.
 The file <i>objectdb.jar</i> contains implementations of <i>javax.jdo</i> and <i>com.objectdb</i> packages.
 If you're setting these environment variables from a command window,
 here is a
 <a href="environment-jdo.txt">page</a> to help you.
 If you are an Eclipse user, use your favorite method to add a .<i>jar</i> file to a Java project.
 <a href="http://www.wikihow.com/Add-JARs-to-Project-Build-Paths-in-Eclipse-%28Java%29">How to add .jar files to project build paths in Eclipse</a>.
</ul>

<!--
You can see the values of these environment variables by the commands:
<blockquote>
 c:\echo %path%
 <br>
 c:\echo %classpath%
</blockquote>
-->

Now you're ready to build JDO/ObjectDB databases.
Building a database takes three steps.

<ol>
<li>
 Write Java classes to implement your UML model.
 All persistent classes must include the annotation:
 <blockquote>
 @javax.jdo.annotations.PersistenceCapable
 </blockquote>
<li>
 Compile the classes and produce <em>.class</em> files.
 These <em>.class</em> files are usual JVM bytecode files you're
 familiar with. 
 At this stage,
 they implement <b>transient classes</b> whose objects
 created during an execution of a program cease to exist
 at termination of the execution.
 Therefore, the <em>.class</em> files with the PersistenceCapable annotation need to be modified to implement
 persistent classes so that
 the objects can be stored in a database after program executions.
 This transformation process from transient class files into
 persistent class files is called <b>enhancement</b>.
<li>
 Execute enhancement by com.objectdb.Enhancer.
</ol>

Let's go through the above steps using the example college database.
(We'll use an abridged set of classes due to the 10-class limit of the free version of ObjectDB.)

<ol>
<li>
 Here are 10 Java classes implementing a portion of the college
 database UML model:
 <a href="demo/Name.java">Name</a>,
 <a href="demo/Person.java">Person</a>,
 <a href="demo/Student.java">Student</a>,
 <a href="demo/Professor.java">Professor</a>,
 <a href="demo/Office.java">Office</a>,
 <a href="demo/Department.java">Department</a>,
 <a href="demo/Course.java">Course</a>, 
 <a href="demo/CourseSection.java">CourseSection</a>,
 <a href="demo/Grade.java">Grade</a>,
 <a href="demo/Take.java">Take</a>,

 The class <a href="demo/Utility.java">Utility</a> contains two useful functions.
 The class <a href="demo/CreateData.java">CreateData</a> constructs example objects and relation instances.
 The <i>Utility</i> and <i>CreateData</i> classes will remain transient classes and do not need
 the PersistenceCapable annotation.
 Download these to your computer and put them in a new folder,
 say c:\ODB\College.

<li>
 Compile the 12 classes, including <i>Utility</i> and <i>CreateData</i>, and produce 12 <em>.class</em> files.
 The Java compiler will probably issue a warning note like:

 <blockquote> 
 Note: Some input files use unchecked or unsafe operations.
 <br>
 Note: Recompile with -Xlint:unchecked for details.
 </blockquote>

 This is a warning that runtime check for type casts to Collection types will not be performed for efficiency reason. 
 You can safely ignore it if you're using type casts correctly.

<li>
 Enhance the 10 <em>.class</em> files to
 persistent class files; <i>Utility</i> and <i>CreateData</i> will remain transient. 
 First, be sure to include the college folder in the classpath.
 A one-off way of doing this from a command window in Windows is to execute:
 <br><br>

 set classpath=%classpath%;c:\ODB\College

 <br><br>
 Enhance the <em>.class</em> files by the command:
 <br><br>
 c:\ODB\College&gt;  java &nbsp; com.objectdb.Enhancer &nbsp; c:\ODB\College\*.class
 <br><br>

 You should get the following response:
 <pre>
10 persistable types have been enhanced:
    Course
    CourseSection
    Department
    Grade
    Name
    Office
    Person
    Professor
    Student
    Take
2 NON persistable types have been enhanced:
    CreateData
    Utility
 </pre>

 The 10 classes have now become persistent, and you're ready to
 populate the classes with persistent objects.
 <br><br>
 If you get a message different from the above,
 the 10 files have not been transformed into persistent classes successfully.
 This likely means one or both of the following:
 <br><br>

 <ul>
 <li>
  You omitted or mistyped the PersistenceCapable annotation.
 <li>
  The classpath wasn't set properly.
 </ul>
<li>
 Run <i>CreateData</i>:

 <br><br>
 c:\ODB\College&gt; java &nbsp; CreateData
 <br><br>

 This will create the database file <i>test.odb</i> and display the results of the example queries
 included in <i>CreateData.java</i>.
 Beware: Running <i>CreateData</i> more than once
 will keep adding the same duplicate data to <i>test.odb</i>.
 To prevent this, delete or rename <i>test.odb</i> before rerunning <i>CreateData</i>.

<li>
 Open ObjectDB Explorer, which is <i>explorer.jar</i> in the <i>bin</i> folder.
 Load <i>test.odb</i> and explore the database by various viewing features, especially "Tree Window".

</ol>

The manual enhancement process by com.objectdb.Enhancer may be omitted in most if not all cases.
This is because, if manual enhancement is omitted, the ObjectDB runtime system will perform
automatic on-the-fly enhancement during class-file loading.
This option, however, slows down execution and does not work in all cases, so manual enhancement is recommended.

on this issue.
