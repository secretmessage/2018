Exercise Set #5

<font face="verdana" size=-1>

<b>Exercise 1</b>.

The following query retrieves all students each of whom has at least two other students
with the same last name:

<br><br>

Unbound variables: s2: Student, s3: Student

</font>

<pre>
{ s1: Student | s1.name.lastName == s2.name.lastName &&
                s2.name.lastName == s3.name.lastName &&
                s1 != s2 && s2 != s3 && s3 != s1  }
</pre>

<font face="verdana" size=-1>

<ol>
<li>
 What would be the result of the query if the condition "s1 != s2" were omitted?
 What if "s2 != s3" or "s3 != s1" were omitted?
<li>
 What would be the result of the query if the condition "s1 != s2 && s2 != s3"
 were omitted?
</ol>

<b>Exercise 2</b>.

Consider the following JDO class definitions.

</font>

<pre>
Class Book                                   Class Publisher
{ String title;                              { String name; // key attribute 
  HashSet&lt;Author&gt; writtenBy;                   HashSet&lt;Book&gt; published;
  Publisher publishedBy;                     }
    // the inverse of Publisher.published
}

Class Author
{ String authorID; // key attribute
  HashSet&lt;Book&gt; wrote; // the inverse of Book.writtenBy
}
</pre>

<font face="verdana" size=-1>

Note: The relation "an author wrote a book" includes cases where
an author co-wrote a book with other authors; likewise for the inverse
relation <i>writtenBy</i>.

<br><br>

For each of the following descriptions of queries pertaining to the above
classes, give a JDOQL query in set form.
If necessary, use suitable bound and/or unbound variables, and specify
the bound/unbound variables used along with their types;
also, give the logical interpretation of the query using existential quantifiers.

<br><br>

<b>Exercise 3</b>.

<br><br>

<b>Exercise 4</b>.

Code the functions 1 through 9 in Exercise 3 using JDOQL queries.
Each function will have an extra parameter of Query type and
return a Collection instead of a HashSet.

<br><br>

<b>Exercise 5</b>.

Consider the following JDO class definitions.

</font>

<pre>
   class  Order                           class  Customer
   {   String  orderID;  /* key */        {    String  customerID;  /* key */
       HashSet&lt;Item&gt;  includes;                HashSet&lt;Order&gt;  placed;
   }                                      }

   class  Item
   {   String  itemID;  /* key */
       HashSet&lt;Order&gt;  includedIn;   /*  The inverse relation of Order.includes  */
   }
</pre>

<font face="verdana" size=-1>

Give JDOQL queries in set form to retrieve each of the following.

<ol>
<li>
Get all customers that placed an order that includes the item with itemID = "123".
<li>
Get all customers that placed an order that includes at least five items.
<li>
Get all customers that have ordered at least two different items, not necessarily in one order.
<li>
Get all customers that have placed at least one order and have only ordered the item with itemID = "123" 
(i.e., have never ordered any item with itemID &ne; "123").
</ol>

<b>Exercise 6</b>. 
Consider the JDO class definitions in Exercise 5. Give full Java/JDO function code for 
each of the following. The class to which the function belongs is shown inside [ ... ]. 

<ol>

<li>
<b>int &nbsp; countOrders( ) &nbsp; [Item]</b>
<br>
Returns the total number of orders that include the target item.  

<li>
<b>static &nbsp; Customer &nbsp; find( String  s, PersistenceManager pm ) &nbsp; [Customer]</b>
<br>
Returns the customer whose customerID is equal to the parameter <i>s</i>; 
returns null if no such customer exists. 
The function is applied to the database held by the persistence manager <i>pm</i>.

<li>
<b>boolean &nbsp; includedInAtLeast( int  x ) &nbsp; [Item]</b>
<br>
Tests if the target item is included in at least <i>x</i> orders. 

<li>
<b>boolean &nbsp; addItem( Item  i ) &nbsp; [Order]</b>
<br>
Adds the parameter item <i>i</i> to the <i>includes</i> field of the target order, and returns true; 
the inverse relation <i>i.includedIn</i> must also be adjusted appropriately. 
If the item <i>i</i> already exists in the <i>includes</i> field, does nothing and returns false.

<li>
<b>Collection&lt;Order&gt; &nbsp; OrdersByCustomerItem( Item  i, Query q ) &nbsp; [Customer]</b>
<br>
Returns the collection of all orders placed by the target customer that include the parameter item <i>i</i>.

<li>
<b>static &nbsp; Collection&lt;Order&gt; &nbsp; includesAtLeastOne( HashSet&lt;String&gt;  ii, Query q ) &nbsp; [Item]</b>
<br>
Returns the collection of all orders that each include at least one item whose itemID is
contained in the set <i>ii</i>.

<li> 
<b>Customer &nbsp; isPlacedBy( PersistenceManager pm ) &nbsp; [Order]</b>
<br>
Returns the customer that placed the target order; 
this computes the inverse relation of Customer.placed.
 
<li>
<b>Collection&lt;Item&gt;  &nbsp; items( Query q ) &nbsp; [Customer]</b>
<br>
Returns the collection of all items that have been ordered by the target customer.

</ol>
