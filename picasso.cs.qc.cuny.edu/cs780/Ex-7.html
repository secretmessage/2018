<b>1.</b>

What are the two main tasks of the transaction manager?

<br><br>

<b>2.</b>
<ol type=a>
<li>
Describe the <i>atomicity</i> property of transactions.
<li>
Define: a <i>serial</i> schedule for a set of transactions.
<li>
Define: a <i>serializable</i> schedule for a set of transactions.
<li>
Explain the significance of serial schedules.
<li>
Explain the significance of serializable schedules.
</ol>

<b>3.</b>
Consider the following transaction code T<sub>1</sub> and T<sub>2</sub>:

<br><br>

T<sub>1</sub>: r(X); r(Y); X=X+Y; w(X); r(Z); Y=X+Y+Z; w(Y);

<br>

T<sub>2</sub>: r(X); r(Y); Y=X+Y; w(Y); r(Z); Z=X+Z; w(Z);

<ol type=a>
<li>
Find an optimal application of lock and unlock.
<li>
Toward the end of Section 4 of Course Notes #11, two optimal applications of read-locks, write-locks, and locks
to T<sub>2</sub> are given (without read-to-write upgrade).
Find two more optimal applications.
</ol>

<b>4.</b>

Consider the following transaction code T<sub>1</sub>, T<sub>2</sub>:

<br><br>

T<sub>1</sub>:
r(X); r(Y); r(Z); X = X+Y+Z; w(X);
<br>
T<sub>2</sub>:
r(X); r(Y); r(Z); Z = X+Y+Z; w(Z);

<ol type=a>
<li>
Find an optimal application of lock and unlock.
<li>
Find an optimal application of read-lock, write-lock, and unlock using ternary locking
without read-to-write upgrade.
<li>
Find an optimal application of read-lock, write-lock, and unlock using ternary locking
with read-to-write upgrade.
</ol>

<b>5.</b>
Consider the following transaction code T<sub>1</sub>, T<sub>2</sub>
using ternary locking without read-to-write upgrade.

<br><br>

T<sub>1</sub>:

w-lock(X); r(X), r-lock(Z); r(Z), unlock(Z); X = X+Z; w(X); unlock(X);

<br>

T<sub>2</sub>:

r-lock(X); r(X); r-lock(Y); r(Y), unlock(X); w-lock(Z); unlock(Y); r(Z); Z=X+Y+Z; w(Z); unlock(Z);

<ol type=a> 
<li>
Beginning with the database state (X, Y, Z) = (10, 20, 30),
show the database states resulting from two serial schedules T<sub>1</sub>; T<sub>2</sub>; and
T<sub>2</sub>; T<sub>1</sub>;.
<li>
Find one non-serializable schedule of T<sub>1</sub> and T<sub>2</sub> which,
when started with (X, Y, Z) = (10, 20, 30), produces a database state different from
the two states obtained in (a).
<li>
Find the part of the code violating the two-phase protocol and fix it.
</ol>

<b>6.</b>
Consider the following two transaction code segments to transfer $X from account A to account B.

</font>

<pre>
T<sub>1</sub>:                        T<sub>2</sub>:
r(A);                      r(A);
if ( A >= X )              if ( A >= X )
{    A = A - X;            {   r(B);
     w(A);                     A = A - X;
     r(B);                     B = B + X;
     B = B + X;                w(A);
     w(B);                     w(B);
}                          }
</pre>

For each of T<sub>1</sub> and T<sub>2</sub>,

<ol type=a>
<li>
Find an optimal application of lock and unlock.
<li>
Find an optimal application of read-lock, write-lock, and unlock using ternary locking
without read-to-write upgrade.
<li>
Find an optimal application of read-lock, write-lock, and unlock using ternary locking
with read-to-write upgrade.
</ol>

Be careful about the presence of the if conditional.

<br><br>

<b>7.</b>
Consider the following code to reserve a seat:

</font>

<pre>
r( seatNum );
r( reserved[seatNum] );
if ( reserved[seatNum] == false )
{       reserved[seatNum] = true;
        w( reserved[seatNum] );
        r( totalNumReserved );
        totalNumReserved = totalNumReserved + 1;
        w( totalNumReserved );
}

<ol type=a>
<li>
Find an optimal application of lock and unlock.
<li>
Find an optimal application of read-lock, write-lock, and unlock using ternary locking
without read-to-write upgrade.
<li>
Find an optimal application of read-lock, write-lock, and unlock using ternary locking
with read-to-write upgrade.

Be careful about the presence of the if conditional.

<b>8.</b>
[Preventing starvation of writers] Modify the algorithm for read-lock(A) given in Section 4 of 
Course Notes #11 so that 
once a writer is put on queue[A], 
transactions attempting read-lock(A) are placed on a queue
until after the writer is granted write access.

<br><br>

<b>9.</b>
This question concerns the deadlock issue described at the end of &sect;5 of Course Notes #13.
Modify the algorithm for unlock(A) given in &sect;4 to salvage the <i>m</i> = 1 case,
so that the one self-deadlocked transaction is safely removed from queue[A], upgraded to have write-lock on A,
and resumes its execution.
