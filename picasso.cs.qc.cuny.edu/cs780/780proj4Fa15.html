PROJECT 4: JDOQL Queries
<br>
<b>Due: 12/20/15, Sunday, 11 PM 
<br>
No late submission will be accepted.
This project must be completed individually &ndash; no group work permitted.
</b>

<br><br>

<b>
Use <a href="http://www.objectdb.com/object/db/database/download">ObjectDB version 2.6.4</a>
for this project
(this seems to be the most recent, stable version).
</b>
</font>

<p>
This project deals with the following classes for a laptop database:
<a href = "proj4Fa15/Product.java">Product</a>,
<a href = "proj4Fa15/Laptop.java">Laptop</a>,
<a href = "proj4Fa15/Processor.java">Processor</a>,
<a href = "proj4Fa15/Memory.java">Memory</a>,
<a href = "proj4Fa15/Company.java">Company</a>.
<a href = "proj4Fa15/Utility.java">Utility</a> has generic functions to print collections
and to extract the element from a singleton collection;
this class will be compiled with the above five but will not be
transformed into a persistent class.
</p>

<p>
For each of the following functions,
you are to provide code of its body correctly implementing
the specification given in the comment:
<ol>
<li>
Processor.installedOn
<li>
Memory.installedOn
<li>
Company.memoryProcessor
<li>
Company.differentCompanyProcessor
<li>
Laptop.find
<li>
Laptop.HDandHardDrive
<li>
Laptop.speedPrice
<li>
Laptop.hasProcessor
<li>
Laptop.laptopProcessorMadeBySameCompany
<li>
Laptop.sameProcessor
<li>
Laptop.groupByCompany
</ol>
All these functions are to use JDOQL queries.
It may be advantageous to start with relevant JDOQL queries in set form.
For visualization, it may be helpful to draw a UML diagram of the database.
<b>Do not change anything in the given class definitions and
the function headers.</b>
Place all the classes in one folder, the default package.
</p>
 
<p>
<a href="proj4Fa15/Test1.java">Test1</a> and <a href="proj4Fa15/Test2.java">Test2</a>
are programmed to do some testing with
example <a href = "proj4Fa15/laptop1.odb">laptop1.odb</a> and <a href = "proj4Fa15/laptop2.odb">laptop2.odb</a> database files, respectively.
To test your function code by these, download them to the same folder
that has your laptop class files, and run the main functions.
The correct output should be identical to
<a href = "proj4Fa15/proj4Fa15out1.txt">Test1 output</a> and
<a href = "proj4Fa15/proj4Fa15out2.txt">Test2 output</a>.
The contents of these databases can be inspected by Explorer.
You might do your own testing by adding test code to the main function.
