<b>Midterm Examination</b>
<br><br>
Date/Time: 03/20/18, TU, 5 &ndash; 6:15 PM
<br>
Room: B 137

<br><br>

The exam material will cover up to and including
hierarchical decomposition of aggregate/composite objects and
inter-part local relations. 

<br><br>

You are responsible for studying your class notes up to
and including composite structure diagrams, 
Course Notes #1 through #5, and Exercise Set #1, #2, #3.
It will also be helpful to look over the following
materials.

<ul>

<li>
Example College Database
<ul>
<li>
<A href ="QC5-1/ClassDiagram_IOZU1V8AwLzSRwVG.html">
UML Specification</A>
(generated by Visual Paradigm)
<li>
Example JDO/ObjectDB Implementation:
 <a href ="Name.java">Name</a>,
 <a href ="OfficeInfo.java">OfficeInfo</a>,
 <a href ="Person.java">Person</a>,
 <a href ="Student.java">Student</a>,
 <a href ="Employee.java">Employee</a>,
 <a href ="Employment.java">Employment</a>,
 <a href ="Professor.java">Professor</a>,
 <a href ="Staff.java">Staff</a>,
 <a href ="Course.java">Course</a>, 
 <a href ="CourseSection.java">CourseSection</a>,
 <a href ="Grade.java">Grade</a>,
 <a href ="Take.java">Take</a>,
 <a href ="Office.java">Office</a>,
 <a href ="Department.java">Department</a>.
 Some of the classes have functions;
 for the midterm exam you can ignore the functions and concentrate on the attributes.
 Also, these classes use HashSet&lt;C&gt; and TreeSet&lt;C&gt;,
 which are subclasses of Set&lt;C&gt;.
 At this time simply regard them as special cases of Set&lt;C&gt;;
 in the midterm exam, relations with multiplicities of more than one
 should be implemented
 by Set&lt;C&gt; as done in class.
