<h2>
B<sup>+</sup> Trees
</h2>
</center>

Throughout Course Notes #11,
&lceil;X&rceil; will denote the ceiling integer of X.

<br><br>

B<sup>+</sup> trees are multiway balanced trees whose nodes are blocks/pages of the secondary storage, defined as follows.

<br><br>

<b>Definition</b>

Let <i>N</i> be an integer greater than or equal to 3.
A <em>B<sup>+</sup> tree of order N</em> must satisfy the following conditions.

<br><br>
1.
 Each node contains <i>n</i> pointers 
 p<sub>i</sub>, 1 &le; i &le; <i>n</i>, and
 <i>n</i>&minus;1 index values k<sub>i</sub>, 1 &le; i &le; <i>n</i>&minus;1.
 The value of <i>n</i> must satisfy
 &lceil;<i>N</i>/2&rceil; &le; <i>n</i> &le; <i>N</i> for all nodes except the root node
 of the tree;
 the root node must satisfy 2 &le; <i>n</i> &le; <i>N</i>.
 The index values in each node must be sorted in strictly increasing order k<sub>1</sub> < &hellip; < k<sub>n&minus;1</sub>.
 <ul>
 <li>
  For a leaf node: 
  Each p<sub>i</sub>, 1 &le; i &le; <i>n</i>&minus;1,
  points to an object whose index
  value is k<sub>i</sub> or to a bucket of objects whose index values are all k<sub>i</sub>.
  The last pointer p<sub>n</sub> points to the "right neighbor" leaf node.
 <li>
  For a non-leaf node:
  Each p<sub>i</sub>, 1 &le; i &le; <i>n</i>, points to a child node.
  It is required that the following sortedness conditions hold:
  <ul>
  <li>
   all index values in the subtree pointed to by p<sub>1</sub> &lt; k<sub>1</sub>,
  <li>
   k<sub>i&minus;1</sub> &le; (all index values in the subtree pointed to by p<sub>i</sub>) &lt;
   k<sub>i</sub>, 2 &le; i &le; <i>n</i>&minus;1,
  <li>
   k<sub>n&minus;1</sub> &le; all index values in the subtree pointed to by p<sub>n</sub>.
  </ul>
 </ul>
2.
 All leaf nodes must be at the same level (balanced-tree condition).

<br><br>

The leaf nodes form a linked list by the last pointers p<sub>n</sub>'s.

<br><br>

An example B<sup>+</sup> tree of order 4 is given on a
<a href="BplusTree.jpg">separate page</a>
(the order of 4 is unrealistically small, but it's hard to display
example B<sup>+</sup> trees with higher orders!).
The order N is the maximum number of
pointers in each node.
The storage manager determines the value of N from the sizes of a block, index value, and pointer.
For example, consider B<sup>+</sup> trees whose nodes each have 4KB = 2<sup>12</sup> = 4096 bytes. 
Assume that 8 bytes are used by each index and by each pointer, 
and 96 bytes are set aside in each node for bookkeeping purposes. 
Then this condition must hold:
8N + 8(N&minus;1) + 96 &le; 4096.
So N &le; 4008/16 = 250.5, and we see the maximum value of N is 250.

<br><br>

The following theorem follows from the definition.

<br><br>
<b>Theorem</b>
Let <i>T</i> be any B<sup>+</sup> tree of order <i>N</i>, <i>M</i> the total number of
index values contained in the leaf nodes, and <i>h</i> the height of <i>T</i>.
Then:
<br><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;
&lceil;N/2&rceil;<sup>h&minus;1</sup>(N&minus;2) 
&le; M &le;
N<sup>h</sup>(N&minus;1)

<br><br>
<b>Proof</b>
Let h be an arbitrary but fixed height.
The number of leaf nodes in T is minimized when
all non-leaf nodes have the minimum number of pointers, namely when
the root has two pointers and all the other non-leaf nodes have
&lceil;N/2&rceil; pointers.
In such trees the total number of leaf nodes is
2&lceil;N/2&rceil;<sup>h&minus;1</sup> because the leaf nodes are at height h.
Since the minimum number of index values in each leaf node is &lceil;N/2&rceil;&minus;1,
we conclude that 
M &ge; 2&lceil;N/2&rceil;<sup>h&minus;1</sup>(&lceil;N/2&rceil;&minus;1).
Now, 2(&lceil;N/2&rceil;&minus;1) = 2&lceil;N/2&rceil;&minus;2 is
equal to N&minus;2 if N is even and is equal to N&minus;1 if N is odd.
Hence M &ge; &lceil;N/2&rceil;<sup>h&minus;1</sup>(N&minus;2).
The upper bound of N<sup>h</sup>(N&minus;1) is obtained similarly by considering
the trees in which
every node is full, i.e., has N pointers and N&minus;1 index values.

The following theorem follows immediately from the above theorem.

<br><br>
<b>Theorem</b>
Let <i>T</i> be any B<sup>+</sup> tree of order <i>N</i>, <i>M</i> the total number of
index values contained in the leaf nodes, and <i>h</i> the height of <i>T</i>.
Then:
<br><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; log<sub>N</sub>(M/(N&minus;1)) &le;
h &le; ( log<sub>&lceil;N/2&rceil;</sub>(M/(N&minus;2)) ) + 1

<br><br>

For example, let N = 250 and M = 10<sup>9</sup>.
We obtain from the theorem:
<br><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; log<sub>250</sub>(10<sup>9</sup>/249) &le;
h &le; log<sub>125</sub>(10<sup>9</sup>/248) + 1.

<br><br>

By calculation we get:
2.7539 &le; h &le; 4.1501,
and conclude 3 &le; h &le; 4.

<br><br>

Since N is a constant and bases of logarithm functions do not affect
their asymptotic class, we obtain h = &Theta;(log M).
This is a significant result implying that the time efficiency of
B<sup>+</sup> tree search, insertion, and deletion algorithms is &Theta;(log M).

<br><br>

The following table compares the lower/upper bounds on the height of B<sup>+</sup> trees with N = 250 and
the load factor &alpha; = M/(10<sup>6</sup>&middot;250) of hash tables with array size 10<sup>6</sup> and
the max number 250 of index values per node.

<br><br>

<br>

Up to a threshold value of about M = 10<sup>9</sup> hash tables are more efficient,
whereas beyond this value B<sup>+</sup> trees are more efficient.
Although this is one example,
it clearly shows the superior efficiency of B<sup>+</sup> trees for large values of M.
This is a general fact.
The growth rate of &alpha; is measured by the derivative with respect to M,
(M/(N&middot;n))&prime; = 1/(N&middot;n),
which is a constant assuming array size N is a constant.
The growth rate of log<sub>a</sub>M is (log<sub>a</sub>M)&prime; = (log<sub>a</sub>e)/M,
which approaches 0 as M &rarr; &infin;.
The array size N can be increased to decrease the load factor &alpha;.
Because the efficiency of hash tables depends on random accessibility of array elements,
the array should reside in a fast random access memory.
If the efficiency of hash tables is to be realized fully, therefore,
the array size is constrained by the amount of random access memory that can be allocated to it.

<br><br>

<b>Search Algorithm</b>

<br><br>

Search for an index value <i>k</i> is straightforward.
Starting from the root, it finds the position <i>i</i> such that 
k<sub>i&minus;1</sub> &le; k &lt; k<sub>i</sub> in each non-leaf node and
recursively goes down to the child pointed to by p<sub>i</sub>.
Once a leaf node is reached, it looks for <i>k</i>.

<br><br>
Parameters
<ul>
<li>
p: a pointer to a node.
<li>
k: the index value of the object(s) to be searched.
</ul>

<pre>
Search(p, k)
{
Let NODE be the node pointed by p;
n = # of pointers contained in NODE;
if ( NODE is a leaf )
{
	i = 1;
	while ( i &le; n&minus;1 and k > k[i] ) i = i+1; // find i such that k[i&minus;1] < k &le; k[i]
	// i == n or k &le; k[i]
	if ( i == n or k < k[i] ) // search failure
		return null;
	else // k = k[i], search success
		return p[i];
}
else // NODE is a non-leaf node
{
	i = 1;
	while ( i &le; n&minus;1 and k &ge; k[i] ) i = i+1; // find i such that k[i&minus;1] &le; k < k[i]
	// i == n or k < k[i]
	search( p[i], k );
}
}
</pre>

The above algorithm uses linear search for position <i>i</i> in a single node, with the time efficiency of &Theta;(n).
Since the k<sub>i</sub> are sorted,
a more efficient alternative is binary search with the time efficiency of &Theta;(log<sub>2</sub>n),
which is also usable for insertion and deletion algorithms.

<br><br>

<b>Insertion Algorithm</b>

<br><br>

The insertion algorithm has two phases.
Given an object <i>entry</i> with the index value <i>k</i> to be inserted,
the first phase uses the search algorithm for <i>k</i> to find
the leaf node L where <i>k</i> should be, and inserts <i>entry</i> at
the appropriate position (unless the index attribute is a key
and the object with index <i>k</i> already exists).
If L now has less than N index values,
the insertion is complete.
Otherwise, L is overflowing with N index values and N+1 pointers, and
the second phase of overflow elimination begins.
If L has the left or right sibling with less than N&minus;1 index values,
the leftmost or rightmost object of L, respectively, is moved to
the sibling by the process of rotation, and the insertion is complete.
The diagrams describing the rotation process are given on separate pages.
If L has no such sibling, it is split into two nodes by moving its second half contents
to the new node.
Then a pointer to the new node along with the associated index value
is inserted into L's parent. 
If the parent is not overflowing, the insertion is complete.
Otherwise, the same overflow elimination process repeats recursively upward.
In the worst case, the recursive overflow elimination process may
go all the way up to the root, splitting the nodes along the way.

<br><br>
Parameters
<ul>
<li>
   p: a pointer to a node.
<li>
   entry: the object to be inserted.
<li>
   newchild = (index value, pointer): The output variable containing a pair of
   an index value and a pointer to the new node created by the recursive call.
   Used for upward tree adjustment process caused by creation of new nodes.
   newchild = (null, null) if the recursive call does not create a new node, 
   signaling no more adjustment need be done.

   Strictly speaking, the insertion function also needs the fourth parameter:
   a pointer to the parent node of the node pointed to by p. This is necessary
   for accessing left/right siblings and rotation processes. This parameter
   is not shown in this pseudo code algorithm.
</ul>
N = the order of the tree.

<pre>
Insert(p, entry, newchild)
{

if ( p points to a leaf node L ) // non-recursive case
{
	if ( L has the index value equal to index[entry] )
	{
		if ( the index attribute or attribute list is a key )
			return( Error: the object with the same index value exists );
		else
		{
			insert entry into the bucket of objects with index value = index[entry];
			return();
		}
	}
	else // L has no index value equal to index[entry].
	{
		insert entry at appropriate position in L;
		if ( L has N&minus;1 or less index values )
		{
			newchild = (null, null);
			return(); // insertion complete
		}
		else // L has N index values: overflow.

			{

				make L' the right sibling of L by appropriately setting their rightmost pointers;
				move 2nd half of the index values and associated pointers in L to L';
				newchild = (smallest index value in L', pointer to L'); // This must be inserted into the parent of L unless L is the root.
				if ( L is the root )
				{
					create the new root node R;
					put pointer to L, smallest index value in L', pointer to L', in R;
				}
			}
			return();
		}
	}
} // end leaf node case

else // p points to a non-leaf node. Recursive case.
{
	let NL be the non-leaf node pointed to by p;
	In NL, find i such that k[i&minus;1] &le; index[entry] < k[i];
	insert(p[i], entry, newchild); // Recursively insert entry into the subtree pointed to by p[i].

	if ( newchild == (null, null) ) // No new child need be inserted into NL.
		return();
	else // newchild needs to be inserted into NL.
	{
		insert newchild to the right of p[i] in NL;
		if ( NL has N&minus;1 or less index values )
		{
			newchild = (null, null);

} // end insert

<b>Deletion Algorithm</b>

<br><br>

The index attribute or attribute list is assumed to be a key &ndash; 
otherwise deletion operation for an index value <i>k</i> is ambiguous as
there may be multiple objects with the value <i>k</i>.
The deletion algorithm has two phases.
Given an index value <i>k</i> to be deleted,
the first phase uses the search algorithm for <i>k</i> to find
the leaf node L where <i>k</i> should be, and deletes it along with the associated object from L.
If L now has at least &lceil;N/2&rceil;&minus;1 index values,
the deletion is complete.
Otherwise, L is underflowing with &lceil;N/2&rceil;&minus;2 index values and &lceil;N/2&rceil;&minus;1 pointers, and
the second phase of underflow elimination begins.
If L has the left or right sibling with at least &lceil;N/2&rceil; index values,
the rightmost or leftmost object of the sibling, respectively, is moved to
L by the process of rotation, and the deletion is complete.
If L has no such sibling, it is merged with one of the siblings, and
either L or the sibling is deleted as appropriate.
Then the pointer to the deleted node along with the associated index value
is deleted from L's parent. 
If the parent is not underflowing, the deletion is complete.
Otherwise, the same underflow elimination process repeats recursively upward.
In the worst case, the recursive underflow elimination process may
go all the way up to the root, merging the nodes along the way.

<br><br>
Parameters
<ul>
<li>
   p: a pointer to a node.
<li>
   k: the index value of the object to be deleted. The index attribute or attribute list is
   assumed to be a key; otherwise deletion operation with this parameter is ambiguous as
   there may be multiple objects with the value k.
   (Alternatively, a variation of deletion algorithm may have as a parameter
   a pointer to the object to be deleted instead of a key value k; in this case,
   the index attribute need not be a key. This variation is a straightforward modification
   of this algorithm.)
<li>
   oldchild: The output variable containing a pointer to the node
   to be deleted as a result of merging of two nodes done by the recursive call.
   Used for upward tree adjustment process caused by merging of nodes.
   oldchild = null if the recursive call does not merge nodes, signaling no more
   adjustment need be done.

   Strictly speaking, the deletion function also needs the fourth parameter:
   a pointer to the parent node of the node pointed to by p. This is necessary
   for accessing left/right siblings and rotation processes. This parameter
   is not shown in this pseudo code algorithm.
</ul>
N = the order of the tree.
