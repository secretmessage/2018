P: the class of problems that can be decided by deterministic Turing machines in polynomial time

<br><br>

NP: the class of problems that can be decided by nondeterministic Turing machines in polynomial time

<br><br>

NP-Complete: the subclass of NP problems to which all NP problems reduce in polynomial time

<br><br>

NP-Intermediate = NP &minus; (P &cup; NP-Complete)

<br><br>

PSPACE: the class of problems that can be decided by deterministic Turing machines in polynomial space

<br><br>

NPSPACE: the class of problems that can be decided by nondeterministic Turing machines in polynomial space

<br><br>

PSPACE-Complete: the subclass of PSPACE problems to which all PSPACE problems reduce in polynomial time

<br><br>

EXPTIME: the class of problems that can be decided by deterministic Turing machines in exponential time

In the following,
X &sub; Y means X is a proper subset of Y, i.e., X &sube; Y but X &ne; Y.
