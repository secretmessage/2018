<li>
Consider the polynomial-time reduction 3SAT &le;<sub>p</sub> VERTEX-COVER we studied in class
and the following &phi;:

<blockquote>
&phi;(x<sub>1</sub>, x<sub>2</sub>, x<sub>3</sub>) = 
(&not;x<sub>1</sub> &or; x<sub>2</sub> &or; x<sub>2</sub>) &and;
(x<sub>1</sub> &or; x<sub>1</sub> &or; &not;x<sub>2</sub>) &and;
(x<sub>1</sub> &or; &not;x<sub>2</sub> &or; x<sub>3</sub>) &and;
(x<sub>2</sub> &or; &not;x<sub>3</sub> &or; &not;x<sub>3</sub>)
</blockquote>

Here, &not;x<sub>i</sub> is the negation of x<sub>i</sub>.

  </li>
  <li>
  Give one satisfying assignment for &phi;, and a corresponding k-vertex cover for G<sub>&phi;</sub>
  produced by the equivalence proof.
  </li>
  <li>
  Give one k-vertex cover for G<sub>&phi;</sub> that is distinct from the one you gave in (b), and
  give a corresponding assignment for &phi; produced by the equivalence proof.
  </li>

  </li>
  </ol>

&ne;SAT in Problem 7.26 on page 324 (Problem 7.24 in the 2nd edition).
In addition, solve the following:
<br><br>

  <ol type=i>
  <li>
  Give the Boolean formula, call it &ne;&phi;, the reduction constructs from the formula &phi; in Question 1.

  a corresponding assignment for &phi; produced by the equivalence proof.
  </ol>

<br>

<li>
MAX-CUT in Problem 7.27 on page 325 (Problem 7.25 in the 2nd edition).
In addition, solve the following:
<br><br>

  <ol type=i>
  <li>
  Give the instance of MAX-CUT, (G, k), the reduction constructs from the formula &phi; in Question 1.
  <li>
  Give one cut of size at least k of G, and
  a corresponding &ne;-assignment for &phi; produced by the equivalence proof.
  </ol>

<li>
Many graph problems can be reduced to SAT by encoding adjacency lists.
For example consider the following directed graph:


<br><br>
<img src="assign-3-Q5.svg">
<br><br>

The four nodes are encoded by 2-bit numbers 00, 01, 10, 11.
The following is an adjacency list of all adjacent nodes 
(a<sub>1</sub>a<sub>2</sub>, b<sub>1</sub>b<sub>2</sub>):

<pre>
(00, 01)
(00, 10)
(01, 10)
(10, 11)
(11, 01)
</pre>

This adjacency list is encoded by the formula:

<pre>
adjacent(a<sub>1</sub>, a<sub>2</sub>, b<sub>1</sub>, b<sub>2</sub>) =
(a<sub>1</sub>=0 &and; a<sub>2</sub>=0 &and; b<sub>1</sub>=0 &and; b<sub>2</sub>=1) &or;
(a<sub>1</sub>=0 &and; a<sub>2</sub>=0 &and; b<sub>1</sub>=1 &and; b<sub>2</sub>=0) &or;
(a<sub>1</sub>=0 &and; a<sub>2</sub>=1 &and; b<sub>1</sub>=1 &and; b<sub>2</sub>=0) &or;
(a<sub>1</sub>=1 &and; a<sub>2</sub>=0 &and; b<sub>1</sub>=1 &and; b<sub>2</sub>=1) &or;
(a<sub>1</sub>=1 &and; a<sub>2</sub>=1 &and; b<sub>1</sub>=0 &and; b<sub>2</sub>=1)
</pre>

a<sub>i</sub> = 0 is expressed by &not;a<sub>i</sub> and
a<sub>i</sub> = 1 is expressed by a<sub>i</sub>.
Nodes a<sub>1</sub>a<sub>2</sub> and b<sub>1</sub>b<sub>2</sub> are adjacent iff
adjacent(a<sub>1</sub>, a<sub>2</sub>, b<sub>1</sub>, b<sub>2</sub>) is true.

<br><br>

The above example generalizes as follows.
Let n be the # of nodes and e the # of edges of directed graph G.
The nodes 0, &hellip;, n&minus;1 are encoded by p = &lceil;log<sub>2</sub>n&rceil; bits.
The adjacency list for n nodes is encoded by the formula 
adjacent(a<sub>1</sub>, &hellip;, a<sub>p</sub>, b<sub>1</sub>, &hellip;, b<sub>p</sub>) which is
a disjunction of e conjunctions, each of which containing 2p literals.
Each conjunction encodes an ordered pair of adjacent nodes in the manner illustrated in the above example.

<br><br>

By means of the encoding of adjacency lists described above,
<b>give a direct polynomial-time reduction from HAMPATH to SAT</b>.
Hint: For a directed graph with n nodes,
a Hamiltonian path is a list of n distinct nodes
(v<sub>0</sub>, &hellip;, v<sub>n&minus;1</sub>) such that
adjacent(v<sub>i</sub>, v<sub>i+1</sub>) holds for 0 &le; i &le; n&minus;2.
You must prove the equivalence condition and that your reduction runs in polynomial time.

<br><br>

<li>
By modifying the proof of Cook-Levin Theorem: SAT &isin; NPC,
we can prove that all decidable languages are mapping reducible to SAT,
although not always in polynomial time.
Let L be a decidable language and M a DTM that decides L.

<br><br>

 <ol type=a>
 <li>
 Show that the worst-case time complexity function W<sub>M</sub>(n) is computable by
 describing an algorithm to compute it.
 <li>
 Describe how to modify the proof of Cook-Levin Theorem to prove L &le;<sub>m</sub> SAT, that is,
 L is mapping reducible to SAT;
 use the computability of W<sub>M</sub>(n).
