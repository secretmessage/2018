<br><br>

<li>
Problem 7.41 on page 327 (Problem 7.39 in the 2nd edition).

<br><br>

<li>
Consider the following polynomial-time reduction from CLIQUE to SAT.

<br><br>

We begin by a description of the reduction of the following example graph G, then generalize.

<br><br>
<img src="assign-3-Q6-1.svg">
<br><br>

The four nodes are encoded by 2-bit numbers 00, 01, 10, 11.
The following is an adjacency list of G listing all adjacent nodes 
(a<sub>1</sub>a<sub>2</sub>, b<sub>1</sub>b<sub>2</sub>):

<pre>
(00, 01)
(00, 10)
(01, 00)
(01, 10)
(01, 11)
(10, 00)
(10, 01)
(10, 11)
(11, 01)
(11, 10)
</pre>

This adjacency list is encoded by the formula:

<pre>
adjacent(a<sub>1</sub>, a<sub>2</sub>, b<sub>1</sub>, b<sub>2</sub>) =
(a<sub>1</sub>=0 &and; a<sub>2</sub>=0 &and; b<sub>1</sub>=0 &and; b<sub>2</sub>=1) &or;
(a<sub>1</sub>=0 &and; a<sub>2</sub>=0 &and; b<sub>1</sub>=1 &and; b<sub>2</sub>=0) &or;
...
(a<sub>1</sub>=1 &and; a<sub>2</sub>=1 &and; b<sub>1</sub>=0 &and; b<sub>2</sub>=1) &or;
(a<sub>1</sub>=1 &and; a<sub>2</sub>=1 &and; b<sub>1</sub>=1 &and; b<sub>2</sub>=0)
</pre>

a<sub>i</sub> = 0 is expressed by &not;a<sub>i</sub> and
a<sub>i</sub> = 1 is expressed by a<sub>i</sub>.
Nodes a<sub>1</sub>a<sub>2</sub> and b<sub>1</sub>b<sub>2</sub> are adjacent iff
adjacent(a<sub>1</sub>, a<sub>2</sub>, b<sub>1</sub>, b<sub>2</sub>) is true.

<br><br>

The existence of a 3-clique is encoded by &phi; with three 2-bit node variables
x<sub>1</sub>y<sub>1</sub>, x<sub>2</sub>y<sub>2</sub>, x<sub>3</sub>y<sub>3</sub>:

<pre>
&phi;(x<sub>1</sub>, y<sub>1</sub>, x<sub>2</sub>, y<sub>2</sub>, x<sub>3</sub>, y<sub>3</sub>) =
adjacent(x<sub>1</sub>, y<sub>1</sub>, x<sub>2</sub>, y<sub>2</sub>) &and; 
adjacent(x<sub>1</sub>, y<sub>1</sub>, x<sub>3</sub>, y<sub>3</sub>) &and; 
adjacent(x<sub>2</sub>, y<sub>2</sub>, x<sub>3</sub>, y<sub>3</sub>)
</pre>

Then &phi;(x<sub>1</sub>, y<sub>1</sub>, x<sub>2</sub>, y<sub>2</sub>, x<sub>3</sub>, y<sub>3</sub>)
is satisfiable iff there is a 3-clique of 
nodes x<sub>1</sub>y<sub>1</sub>, x<sub>2</sub>y<sub>2</sub>, x<sub>3</sub>y<sub>3</sub>.

<br><br>

Now the generalization.
Let n be the # of nodes of the input graph G.
If k &gt; n, G cannot have a k-clique, so the reduction immediately generates
a trivial unsatisfiable Boolean formula like x &and; &not;x.
Otherwise, the nodes 0, &hellip;, n&minus;1 are encoded by p = &lceil;log<sub>2</sub>n&rceil; bits.
The adjacency list of n nodes is then encoded by the formula 
adjacent(a<sub>1</sub>, &hellip;, a<sub>p</sub>, b<sub>1</sub>, &hellip;, b<sub>p</sub>) which is
a disjunction of 2&middot;e conjunctions, each of which containing 2p literals, where e is the # of edges of G.
Each conjunction encodes a pair of adjacent nodes in the manner illustrated in the above example.

<br><br>

The existence of a k-clique is encoded by
&phi; with k p-bit node variables

<pre>
&phi;(x<sub>1</sub><sup>1</sup>, ..., x<sub>1</sub><sup>p</sup>, ..., x<sub>k</sub><sup>1</sup>, ..., x<sub>k</sub><sup>p</sup>) =
<font size=+3>&and;</font>adjacent(x<sub>i</sub><sup>1</sup>, ..., x<sub>i</sub><sup>p</sup>, x<sub>j</sub><sup>1</sup>, ..., x<sub>j</sub><sup>p</sup>)
</pre>

where the conjunction is formed for all i, j such that
1 &le; i &lt; j &le; k.

<br><br>

<ol type=a>
<li>
Give the exact number of literals in the above &phi; for the example graph G and k =3.
<li>
Give the Boolean formula generated from the following instance of CLIQUE by the reduction.
Exactly how many literals does your formula have?

<br><br>
<img src="assign-3-Q6-2.svg">
<br><br>

<li>
Give the exact number of literals in &phi; generated from any graph with n nodes and e edges, and
show that it is bounded by a polynomial of n.
</ol>
