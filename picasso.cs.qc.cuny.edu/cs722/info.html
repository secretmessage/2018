</h2>
</center>

<h3>
Course Description
</h3>

Models of computation such as Turing machines, random access machines, and circuits. Time complexity classes, including P and NP, space complexity classes, including L and NL, and the interrelationships among them. Mapping reducibility and its specializations, including polynomial-time and log-space reducibility. Establishing a first NP-complete problem, such as circuit satisfiability or Boolean formula satisfiability. P-complete decision problems; NP-complete decision problems; and related approximation algorithms.
