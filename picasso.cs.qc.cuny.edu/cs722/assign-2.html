If you have not been able to solve a problem completely,
you may show the work you have done for partial points.

in solving assignment problems.

<ol>
<li>
Consider the NTM in
<a href="fa12-assign-1-sol.html">Question 2 here</a>.
<br><br>
 <ol type=a>
 <li>
 Find the <i>exact</i> formula of the worst-case time complexity function, W<sub>M</sub>(n), of this NTM.
 Justify your answer.
 <li>
 This question concerns two examples of the access-path encoding of computation-tree branches used in Theorem NtoV.
 The following are computation trees of the NTM on the input strings "abcab" and "ccc":
 <br>
 <img src="assign-2-Q1.jpeg" width=550 height=670>
 <br>
 In this NTM,
 &delta;(q<sub>0</sub>, c) = {(q<sub>0</sub>, c, R), (q<sub>1</sub>, c, R), (q<sub>3</sub>, c, L)}.
 Sequentially number these three nondeterministic transitions by 1, 2, 3.
 <br><br>
  <ol type=i>
  <li>
  Give the access-path strings that encode the branches of the above computation trees.
  <li>
  Which of these access-path strings are the certificates for "abcab", if any?
  <li>
  Which of these access-path strings are the certificates for "ccc", if any?
  </ol>
 </ol>

<br>

<li>
Consider the following verifier V for the language
L = { wcabx } &cup; { wabcx },
where &Sigma; = { a, b, c }, w, x &isin; &Sigma;<sup>*</sup>,
which is the language decided by the NTM in Question 1.
A proposed certificate encodes a pair &lang;n<sub>1</sub>, n<sub>2</sub>&rang; where
n<sub>1</sub> is a non-negative integer in unary notation and n<sub>2</sub> = 0 or 1.

<pre>
step 1: By consulting n<sub>1</sub>, scan the initial n<sub>1</sub> symbols on tape.
        If the tape head reaches "#" in the scan because n<sub>1</sub> &gt; the input-string length, reject.
step 2: Read n<sub>2</sub>.
        If n<sub>2</sub> = 0, check if the next three tape symbols are "cab";
        if so, accept, o.w., reject.
        If n<sub>2</sub> = 1, check if the previous three tape symbols are "cba" backward;
        if so, accept, o.w., reject.
</pre>

 <ol type =a>
 <li>Prove that V verifies L.
 <br>
 <li>By the method used in the proof of Theorem VtoN, define an NTM equivalent to V.
 </ol>

<br>

<li>
Show that the following problems are in NP.
You don't have to show they are NP-complete.

<br><br>

 <ol type=a>
 <li>LPATH in Problem 7.21 on page 324 (Problem 7.20 in the 2nd edition).
 <li>DOUBLE-SAT in Problem 7.22 on page 324 (Problem 7.21 in the 2nd edition).
 <li>&ne;SAT in Problem 7.26 on page 324 (Problem 7.24 in the 2nd edition).
 <li>MAX-CUT in Problem 7.27 on page 325 (Problem 7.25 in the 2nd edition).
 <li>SET-SPLITTING in Problem 7.30 on page 326 (Problem 7.28 in the 2nd edition).
 </ol>

<br>

<li>
Prove each of the following:
<br><br>
<ol type=a>
<li>
If A, B &isin; NP, then A &cup; B &isin; NP.
<li>
If A, B &isin; NP, then A &cap; B &isin; NP.
<li>
If A, B &isin; NP, then A &middot; B &isin; NP, where 
A &middot; B = { xy | x &isin; A and y &isin; B }.
</ol>

<br>

<li>
Prove each of the following.
You may use any theorems proved in class.
<br><br>
<ol type=a>
<li>
If P &ne; NP, then P &cap; NPC = &empty;.
<li>
If A &isin; NPC, B &isin; NP, and B &notin; NPC, then A &le;<sub>p</sub> B is false.
</ol>
<br>

<li>
Consider the polynomial-time reduction used to prove 3SAT &le;<sub>p</sub> CLIQUE.
Let:

<blockquote>
&phi;(x<sub>1</sub>, x<sub>2</sub>) =
(x<sub>1</sub> &or; x<sub>1</sub> &or; x<sub>2</sub>) &and;
(x<sub>1</sub> &or; x<sub>2</sub> &or; &not;x<sub>2</sub>) &and;
(&not;x<sub>1</sub> &or; &not;x<sub>2</sub> &or; &not;x<sub>2</sub>)
</blockquote>

Here, &not;x<sub>i</sub> is the negation of x<sub>i</sub>.

<br><br>

  <ol type=a>
  <li>
  Give (G<sub>&phi;</sub>, k) constructed from &phi; by the reduction.
  </li>
  <li>
  Give one satisfying assignment A for &phi;, and a corresponding k-clique in G<sub>&phi;</sub>
  produced by the proof.
  </li>
  <li>
  Give one k-clique in G<sub>&phi;</sub> that is distinct from the one you gave in (b), and
  give a corresponding assignment for &phi; produced by the proof.
  </li>
  </ol>
