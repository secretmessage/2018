<li>
Let &Sigma; = { a, b }.
For each w = w<sub>1</sub> &middot;&middot;&middot; w<sub>n</sub> &isin; &Sigma;<sup>*</sup>,
define w<sup>R</sup>, the <i>reverse</i> of w, to be w<sub>n</sub> &middot;&middot;&middot; w<sub>1</sub>,
with the special case &epsilon;<sup>R</sup> = &epsilon;.
For example, (abaab)<sup>R</sup> = baaba.
Consider the language { #ww<sup>R</sup> | w &isin; &Sigma;<sup>*</sup> }.
To facilitate the detection of the leftmost tape cell, every input is presumed to begin with "#".
This language can be decided by an NTM implementing the following algorithm:
<br><br>
<ol type=i>
<li>Scan the input string from left to right and nondeterministically select ("guess") the rightmost symbol of w.
<li>Starting from the rightmost symbol of w selected in step (i),
    cross off a matching pair of a's or of b's in inside-out manner by moving the head back and forth.
    For example, #abaabbaaba would lead to #abaaxxaaba, #abaxxxxaba, #abxxxxxxba, so on.
</ol>
<br>
In sufficient detail, concisely describe a verification TM that is essentially equivalent to this NTM.
Describe the nature of a proposed certificate and how it is used.

<br><br>

<li>
In sufficient detail, describe a polynomial-time nondeterministic algorithm to decide each of the following problems:
<br><br>
<ul>
<li>VERTEX-COVER
<li>SUBSET-SUM
</ul>
<br>
Your algorithm should explicitly use nondeterministic choices at branching points, not one that generates
a proposed certificate nondeterministically.
Show that the worst-case runtime of your algorithm is polynomially bounded.
You may illustrate the algorithms with help of small examples.

<br><br>

<li>
Show that the following problems are in NP.
You don't have to show they are NP-complete.
<br><br>
 <ol type=a>
 <li>PUZZLE in Problem 7.28 on page 325 (Problem 7.26 in the 2nd edition).
 <li>3COLOR in Problem 7.29 on page 325 (Problem 7.27 in the 2nd edition).
 <li>The final exam scheduling problem in Problem 7.31 on page 326 (Problem 7.29 in the 2nd edition).
 <li>The KNAPSACK problem defined as follows.

     <br><br>

     Input: an integer C &gt; 0 (the capacity of the knapsack),
     integers s<sub>i</sub> &gt; 0, 1 &le; i &le; n, (the sizes of n objects),
     integers p<sub>i</sub> &gt; 0, 1 &le; i &le; n, (the profits of n objects), and
     an integer B &gt; 0 (a total profit boundary)

     <br><br>

     Output: decide if there is a subset { k<sub>1</sub>, &hellip;, k<sub>m</sub> } &sube; { 1, &hellip;, n }
     such that s<sub>k<sub>1</sub></sub> + &hellip; + s<sub>k<sub>m</sub></sub> &le; C and
     p<sub>k<sub>1</sub></sub> + &hellip; + p<sub>k<sub>m</sub></sub> &ge; B.


 <li>A version of traveling salesperson problem, DIRECTED-TSP, defined as follows.

     <br><br>

     A directed graph with <i>edge cost</i> is one where each edge <i>e</i> is associated with
     a nonnegative real number c(<i>e</i>) called the cost of <i>e</i>.
     The cost of a path p = (e<sub>1</sub>, ..., e<sub>n</sub>) of n edges is defined to be
     the sum of the costs of the edges c(p) = c(e<sub>1</sub>) + &middot;&middot;&middot; + c(e<sub>n</sub>).

     <br><br>

     Input: (G, s, t, B) where G is a directed graph with edge cost, s, t are two nodes in G,
     B is a nonnegative real number (a total cost boundary)

     <br><br>

     Output: decide if G has a Hamiltonian path p from s to t such that c(p) &le; B.

 </ol>

<br>

<li>
Find a polynomial-time reduction f: SUBSET-SUM &le;<sub>p</sub> KNAPSACK.
You need to define a reduction function f from SUBSET-SUM to KNAPSACK,
show that its worst-case runtime is polynomial, and
prove the equivalence condition.
Presume that in all inputs to SUBSET-SUM,
the elements of the given multiset and the value of t are positive integers.

<br><br>

<li>
Find a polynomial-time reduction f: HAMPATH &le;<sub>p</sub> DIRECTED-TSP.
You need to define a reduction function f from HAMPATH to DIRECTED-TSP,
show that its worst-case runtime is polynomial, and
prove the equivalence condition.

<br><br>

<li>
Languages A and B are said to be <em>polynomially equivalent</em> if A &le;<sub>p</sub> B and B &le;<sub>p</sub> A.
Prove that any two NP-complete languages are polynomially equivalent.
