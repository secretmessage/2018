<p>
In solving homework problems you may consult books other than the textbook and Websites.
You should, however, solve problems mainly by your own thinking, minimizing dependence on search in books and especially the Web.
Excessive search only carries you to solutions someone else found and hampers your learning methods/skills of problem solving.
You may discuss with other students <b>concepts and ideas</b> that might be helpful for finding homework solutions.
Beyond this level, you must complete all homework assignments on your own.
Examples of academic dishonesty include:
outright collaboration leading to submission of identical or near-identical solutions;
submission of a copy of other student's solution; and
submission of a copy of a solution plucked from a Website.
All these and similar acts
constitute cheating in this course and will be handled
according to the Queens College academic regulations.
</p>

<p>
You must take the officially scheduled midterm and final examinations.
The final examination will be held according to the official schedule posted on CUNYfirst.
Makeup exams will be considered only in case of emergencies and 
only if written documents (such as a doctor's statement)
are submitted to prove that <b>highly abnormal</b> events have
prevented you from taking the exam.
You must notify me by email <b>before</b> the exam explaining
why you cannot take the exam and when a document of
proof will be submitted.
You must take the scheduled midterm and final exams even if 
you should suffer from mild cases of sickness or injury
(flu, headache, etc.). 
</p>

<p>
During examinations, no one is to leave the room before
handing in the answer booklets and the exam papers.
Be sure to use a rest room before examinations.
All electronic devices and watches must be stowed away in invisible places, and
cell phones must be set on silent mode.
</p>

<p>
The course grades of all students will be determined by their grades in the midterm exam, final exam, and regularly assigned homework assignments.
Under no circumstance will any student be given
any sort of "extra work" for grade inflation such as additional exams, assignments, or projects.
