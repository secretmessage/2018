<ol>
<li>
Consider the NTM in
<a href="fa12-assign-1-sol.html">Question 2 here</a>.
<br><br>
 <ol type=a>
 <li>
 Find the <i>exact</i> formula of the worst-case time complexity function, W<sub>M</sub>(n), of this NTM.
 Justify your answer.

 <br><br>

 First, we note that M never changes the input string, so we can derive W<sub>M</sub>(n) based solely on
 the input string.

 <br><br>

 Once M enters q<sub>3</sub>, M can never move the tape head to right as q<sub>3</sub> and q<sub>4</sub> have
 no transitions with the head moving to right, and in this case, M can do at most three transitions
 q<sub>0</sub> &rarr; q<sub>3</sub> &rarr; q<sub>4</sub> &rarr; q<sub>accept</sub>.
 All the other transitions move the head to right,
 so M can do at most n R-transitions ending at the blank symbol.
 But if M reads the blank symbol,
 there are no further transitions.
 Hence the worst case would occur when the head moves to right all the way to the last symbol of the input string,
 then entering q<sub>3</sub> and reading "cba" backward,
 performing (n&minus;1)+3 = n+2 transitions.
 This occurs for all and only strings of the form wabc, where w &isin; &Sigma;<sup>*</sup>,
 for which W<sub>M</sub>(n) = n+2, n &ge; 3.
 For n = 0, 1, 2, exhaustive inspection of the strings of these lengths shows that
 W<sub>M</sub>(n) = n if n = 0, 1 and W<sub>M</sub>(n) = n+1 if n = 2.

 <li>
 This question concerns two examples of the access-path encoding of computation-tree branches used in Theorem NtoV.
 The following are computation trees of the NTM on the input strings "abcab" and "ccc":
 <br>
 <img src="assign-2-Q1.jpeg" width=550 height=670>
 <br>
 In this NTM,
 &delta;(q<sub>0</sub>, c) = {(q<sub>0</sub>, c, R), (q<sub>1</sub>, c, R), (q<sub>3</sub>, c, L)}.
 Sequentially number these three nondeterministic transitions by 1, 2, 3.
 <br><br>
  <ol type=i>
  <li>
  Give the access-path strings that encode the branches of the above computation trees.
  <br>
  <img src="assign-2-Q1b-sol.jpeg" width=550 height=670>
  <br>
  <li>
  Which of these access-path strings are the certificates for "abcab", if any?
  <br><br>
  11211 and 11311 are the certificates as they encode accepting branches.
  <br><br>
  <li>
  Which of these access-path strings are the certificates for "ccc", if any?
  <br><br>
  None of them is a certificate as they do not encode accepting branches.
  </ol>
 </ol>

<li>
Consider the following verifier V for the language
L = { wcabx } &cup; { wabcx },
where &Sigma; = { a, b, c }, w, x &isin; &Sigma;<sup>*</sup>,
which is the language decided by the NTM in Question 1.
A proposed certificate encodes a pair &lang;n<sub>1</sub>, n<sub>2</sub>&rang; where
n<sub>1</sub> is a non-negative integer in unary notation and n<sub>2</sub> = 0 or 1.

<pre>
step 1: By consulting n<sub>1</sub>, scan the initial n<sub>1</sub> symbols on tape.
        If the tape head reaches "#" in the scan because n<sub>1</sub> &gt; the input-string length, reject.
step 2: Read n<sub>2</sub>.
        If n<sub>2</sub> = 0, check if the next three tape symbols are "cab";
        if so, accept, o.w., reject.
        If n<sub>2</sub> = 1, check if the previous three tape symbols are "cba" backward;
        if so, accept, o.w., reject.
</pre>

 <ol type =a>
 <li>Prove that V verifies L.

 <br><br>

 We have to prove L = L(V).

 <br><br>

 Suppose v &isin; L.
 Then v = wcabx or wabcx, where w, x &isin; &Sigma;<sup>*</sup>.
 <br>
 Case 1: v = wcabx. Let n<sub>1</sub> = |w|, n<sub>2</sub> = 0.
 When V runs on &lang;v, &lang;n<sub>1</sub>, n<sub>2</sub>&rang;&rang;,
 it scans w in step 1 then detects the next three tape symbols cab in step 2, and accepts, so v &isin; L(V).
 <br>
 Case 2: v = wabcx. Let n<sub>1</sub> = |wabc|, n<sub>2</sub> = 1.
 When V runs on &lang;v, &lang;n<sub>1</sub>, n<sub>2</sub>&rang;&rang;,
 it scans wabc in step 1 then detects the previous three tape symbols cba backward in step 2, and accepts, so v &isin; L(V). 
 <br><br>
 Conversely, suppose v &isin; L(V).
 Then &exist;c s.t. V accepts &lang;v, c&rang;.
 <br>
 Case 1: c = &lang;n<sub>1</sub>, 0&rang;.
 V scans the initial n<sub>1</sub> tape symbols then detects the next three symbols cab.
 So v must be of the form wcabx where |w| = n<sub>1</sub>, hence v &isin; L.
 <br>
 Case 2: c = &lang;n<sub>1</sub>, 1&rang;.
 V scans the initial n<sub>1</sub> tape symbols then detects the previous three symbols cba backward.
 So v must be of the form wabcx where |wabc| = n<sub>1</sub>, hence v &isin; L.

 <br><br>

 <li>By the method used in the proof of Theorem VtoN, define an NTM equivalent to V.

 <br><br>

 Let f(n) be a function as described in Theorem VtoN.
 The equivalent NTM, M, is defined as follows.
 <br><br>
 Given input string w:
 <br><br>
 <ol>
 <li>
 Compute n = |w| and the value of f(n) in unary notation.
 Nondeterministically write a string c s.t. |c| &le; f(n) after w# using
 the string generation NTM module.
 <li>
 Run V on &lang;w, c&rang;.
 Here V also performs format check to ensure that c properly encodes
 &lang;n<sub>1</sub>, n<sub>2</sub>&rang; as part of operation;
 if c is ill formed, V rejects &lang;w, c&rang;.
 <li>
 M accepts w if V accepts &lang;w, c&rang;.
 <br>
 M halts by dead end if V rejects &lang;w, c&rang;.
 </ol>
 </ol>

<li>
Show that the following problems are in NP.
You don't have to show they are NP-complete.

<br><br>

 <ol type=a>
 <li>LPATH in Problem 7.21 on page 324 (Problem 7.20 in the 2nd edition).

 <br><br>
 A proposed certificate is a path of G.
 The verifier determines if this path stars at <i>a</i> and ends at <i>b</i>, is simple (i.e. does not repeat any nodes),
 and has the length at least <i>k</i>.
 This checking can be done in polynomial time in the number of vertices and edges of G.
 <br><br>

 <li>DOUBLE-SAT in Problem 7.22 on page 324 (Problem 7.21 in the 2nd edition).

 <br><br>
 A proposed certificate is a pair of two distinct assignments for &phi;.
 The verifier determines if both assignments satisfy &phi;.
 If so, it accepts &phi;; o.w., it rejects &phi;.
 This checking can be done in polynomial time in the size of &phi;.
 <br><br>

 <li>&ne;SAT in Problem 7.26 on page 324 (Problem 7.24 in the 2nd edition).

 <br><br>
 A proposed certificate is an assignment for &phi;.
 The verifier determines if it satisfies &phi; without making the three literals true in any clause.
 This checking can be done in polynomial time in the size of &phi;.
 <br><br>

 <li>MAX-CUT in Problem 7.27 on page 325 (Problem 7.25 in the 2nd edition).

 <br><br>
 Let V be the set of all vertices of the given graph G.
 A proposed certificate is a set of vertices S &sube; V.
 The verifier checks all edges in G to determine if they have one endpoint in S and
 the other in V&minus;S, and counts the total number of such edges.
 If the total number is &ge; <i>k</i>, the verifier accepts S; o.w., the verifier rejects S.
 This checking can be done in polynomial time in the number of vertices and edges of G.
 <br><br>

 <li>SET-SPLITTING in Problem 7.30 on page 326 (Problem 7.28 in the 2nd edition).

 <br><br>
 A proposed certificate is an assignment of red or blue to the elements of S.
 The verifier determines if every C<sub>i</sub> has an element colored with red and an element colored with
 blue.
 If this is the case, the verifier accepts the color assignment; o.w., the verifier rejects it.
 This checking can be done in polynomial time in 
 |S|+|C<sub>1</sub>|+ &middot;&middot;&middot;+|C<sub>k</sub>|.
 </ol>

<br>

<li>
Prove each of the following.

<br><br>

These can be proved by NTMs or verifiers due to their essential equivalence.

<br><br>
<ol type=a>
<li>
If A, B &isin; NP, then A &cup; B &isin; NP.

<li>
If A, B &isin; NP, then A &cap; B &isin; NP.

<li>
If A, B &isin; NP, then A &middot; B &isin; NP, where 
A &middot; B = { xy | x &isin; A and y &isin; B }.
</ol>

<br>

<li>
Prove each of the following.
You may use any theorems proved in class.
<br><br>
<ol type=a>
<li>
If P &ne; NP, then P &cap; NPC = &empty;.

<br><br>

Suppose P &ne; NP.
By the contrapositive of Theorem 6 (2), there exists no B &isin; P &cap; NPC, so
P &cap; NPC = &empty;.

<br><br>

<li>
If A &isin; NPC, B &isin; NP, and B &notin; NPC, then A &le;<sub>p</sub> B is false.

<br><br>

Suppose A &isin; NPC, B &isin; NP, and B &notin; NPC,
and suppose also that A &le;<sub>p</sub> B is true.
By Theorem 6 (1), A &isin; NPC, B &isin; NP, and A &le;<sub>p</sub> B imply
B &isin; NPC, a contradiction to B &notin; NPC.

</ol>
<br>

<li>
Consider the polynomial-time reduction used to prove 3SAT &le;<sub>p</sub> CLIQUE.
Let:

<blockquote>
&phi;(x<sub>1</sub>, x<sub>2</sub>) =
(x<sub>1</sub> &or; x<sub>1</sub> &or; x<sub>2</sub>) &and;
(x<sub>1</sub> &or; x<sub>2</sub> &or; &not;x<sub>2</sub>) &and;
(&not;x<sub>1</sub> &or; &not;x<sub>2</sub> &or; &not;x<sub>2</sub>)
</blockquote>

Here, &not;x<sub>i</sub> is the negation of x<sub>i</sub>.

<br><br>

  <ol type=a>
