Review Exercises for Midterm Exam
</h3>
</center>

The following exercises should help your preparations for the midterm exam, but
do not necessarily guarantee you will pass it. 
Since answers to them are straightforward or can be found 
in your class notes and/or the textbook, solutions will not be posted here.
