Only hard copies will be accepted.
Late submissions and email submissions will not be accepted.
If you have not been able to solve a problem completely,
you may show the work you have done for partial points.

<ol>

<li>
Consider the nondeterministic algorithm to decide VERTEX-COVER in
<a href="assign-2-sol.html">Question 2, Assignment #2</a>.
Presume that this algorithm is implemented by an NTMR and an encoded input
&lang;G, k&rang; is stored on the read-only input tape.
Analyze the worst-case space complexity and express it in O(f(n)) notation where n is
the size of &lang;G, k&rang;.
<br><br>

<li>
Let
<blockquote>
&psi;(x<sub>1</sub>, x<sub>2</sub>, x<sub>3</sub>) =
(x<sub>1</sub> &or; x<sub>2</sub> &or; x<sub>3</sub>) &and;
(&not;x<sub>1</sub> &or; x<sub>2</sub> &or; x<sub>3</sub>) &and;
(&not;x<sub>1</sub> &or; x<sub>2</sub> &or; &not;x<sub>3</sub>) &and;
(x<sub>1</sub> &or; &not;x<sub>2</sub> &or; &not;x<sub>3</sub>)
</blockquote>

<ol type=a>
<li>
Give an evaluation tree for &psi; by assigning x<sub>i</sub> = 0 and 1, 1 &le; i &le; 3.

<li>
Evaluate each of the following formulas and determine which player (E or A) has a winning strategy.
Justify your answers.
<br><br>
  <ol type=i>
  <li>&exist;x<sub>1</sub>&forall;x<sub>2</sub>&exist;x<sub>3</sub>&psi;(x<sub>1</sub>, x<sub>2</sub>, x<sub>3</sub>)
  <li>&forall;x<sub>1</sub>&exist;x<sub>2</sub>&forall;x<sub>3</sub>&psi;(x<sub>1</sub>, x<sub>2</sub>, x<sub>3</sub>)
  </ol> 
</ol>
<br>

<li>
Study GENERALIZED GEOGRAPHY in &sect;8.3 of the book, especially the polynomial-time reduction from
FORMULA-GAME to GENERALIZED GEOGRAPHY.
Recall that FORMULA-GAME is a 2-player game interpretation of TQBF.
For each of the formulas (i) and (ii) in Question 2, (b),
answer the following questions:

<br><br>

<ol type=a>
<li>
Give the directed graph generated from the formula by the polynomial-time reduction.
<li>
Give an assignment for x<sub>i</sub>, 1 &le; i &le; 3, that is an instance of a winning strategy for
the formula, and show the corresponding path selected by players I and II in the graph.
Mark the edges of the path by "I" or "II" according as they are selected by player I or II, respectively.
</ol>
<br>

<li>
Prove: If &exist;A &isin; NP &cap; PSPACE-Complete, then NPC = PSPACE-Complete.
You may use any of the theorems proved in class.
