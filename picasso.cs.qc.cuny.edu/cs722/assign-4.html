<ol>
<li>
Let
<blockquote>
&psi;(x<sub>1</sub>, x<sub>2</sub>, x<sub>3</sub>) =
(&not;x<sub>1</sub> &or; x<sub>2</sub>) &and;
(x<sub>1</sub> &or; &not;x<sub>2</sub>) &and;
(x<sub>1</sub> &or; &not;x<sub>2</sub> &or; x<sub>3</sub>) &and;
(x<sub>2</sub> &or; &not;x<sub>3</sub>)
</blockquote>

<ol type=a>
<li>
Give an evaluation tree for &psi; by assigning x<sub>i</sub> = 0 and 1, 1 &le; i &le; 3.

<li>
Evaluate each of the following formulas and determine which player (E or A) has a winning strategy.
Justify your answers.
<br><br>
  <ol type=i>
  <li>&exist;x<sub>1</sub>&forall;x<sub>2</sub>&exist;x<sub>3</sub>&psi;(x<sub>1</sub>, x<sub>2</sub>, x<sub>3</sub>)
  <li>&forall;x<sub>1</sub>&exist;x<sub>2</sub>&forall;x<sub>3</sub>&psi;(x<sub>1</sub>, x<sub>2</sub>, x<sub>3</sub>)
  </ol> 
</ol>
<br>

<li>
Study GENERALIZED GEOGRAPHY in &sect;8.3 of the book, especially the polynomial-time reduction from
FORMULA-GAME to GENERALIZED GEOGRAPHY.
Recall that FORMULA-GAME is a 2-player game interpretation of TQBF.
For each of the formulas (i) and (ii) in Question 1, (b),
answer the following questions:

<br><br>

<ol type=a>
<li>
Give the directed graph generated from the formula by the polynomial-time reduction.
<li>
Give an assignment for x<sub>i</sub>, 1 &le; i &le; 3, that is an instance of a winning strategy for
the formula, and show the corresponding path selected by players I and II in the graph.
Mark the edges of the path by "I" or "II" according as they are selected by player I or II, respectively.
</ol>
<br>

<li>
Consider the limited version of TQBF where the number of universal quantifiers in each input formula is
at most a <i>finite constant k</i> independent of the size of the input formula.
Let us call this problem TQBF-finite&forall;.
Prove that TQBF-finite&forall; &isin; NPC.
Hint: Find a polynomial-time reduction from TQBF-finite&forall; to SAT that eliminates
all universal quantifiers.

<br><br>

<li>
Consider the log-space reduction used in the proof of PATH &isin; NL-Complete.
Modify this reduction so that it generates an <i>undirected</i> graph G, that is,
the reduction generates an <i>undirected</i> edge between C<sub>1</sub> and C<sub>2</sub> iff
C<sub>1</sub> |&minus;<sub>M</sub> C<sub>2</sub>.
Is this a valid reduction proving that the path problem for undirected graphs is NL-Complete?
Justify your answer.
