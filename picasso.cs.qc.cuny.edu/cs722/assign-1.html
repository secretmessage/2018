<li>
The following is a 1-tape DTM that decides { 0<sup>m</sup>#0<sup>n</sup> | 0 &le; m &le; n },
&Sigma; = { 0, # }, &Gamma; = { 0, #, x, _ }.
For brevity of the diagram, q<sub>reject</sub> and all transitions leading to q<sub>reject</sub> are omitted;
any transition &delta;(q, s) not shown in the diagram is understood to be &delta;(q, s) = (q<sub>reject</sub>, s, R).

<b>Description of the algorithm</b>
The string to the left of "#" (originally 0<sup>m</sup>) will be called the left part,
and the string to the right of "#" (originally 0<sup>n</sup>) will be called the right part.

<br><br>

The overall idea is to repeatedly cross off the leading 0 of the left part and the leading 0 of the right part.
<br>
If the input is 0<sup>m</sup>#0<sup>n</sup>, m &le; n, the tape string will reach the form
x<sup>m</sup>#x<sup>m</sup>0<sup>n&minus;m</sup>, and accept.
<br>
If the input is 0<sup>m</sup>#0<sup>n</sup>, m &gt; n, the tape string will reach the form
x<sup>n</sup>0<sup>m&minus;n</sup>#x<sup>n</sup>, and reject.

<br><br>

  <ol type=1>
  <li>Cross off the first 0 of left part by x (q<sub>0</sub> &rarr; q<sub>1</sub>).
  <li>Skip the following 0's (q<sub>1</sub> &rarr; q<sub>1</sub>).
  <li>Detect # (q<sub>1</sub> &rarr; q<sub>2</sub>).
  <li>Skip the following x's (q<sub>2</sub> &rarr; q<sub>2</sub>).
      <br>
      If 0 is not found in q<sub>2</sub>, 
      then the current configuration is x<sup>n+1</sup>0<sup>m&minus;n&minus;1</sup>#x<sup>n</sup>q<sub>2</sub>_, m&minus;n &gt; 0,
      meaning the input is 0<sup>m</sup>#0<sup>n</sup>, m &gt; n, hence reject.
  <li>Cross off the first 0 of right part by x (q<sub>2</sub> &rarr; q<sub>3</sub>).
  <li>Move the tape head leftward by skipping x's (q<sub>3</sub> &rarr; q<sub>3</sub>), <br>
      then detecting # (q<sub>3</sub> &rarr; q<sub>4</sub>), <br>
      then skipping 0's (q<sub>4</sub> &rarr; q<sub>4</sub>), <br>
      until the rightmost x in the left part is found (q<sub>4</sub> &rarr; q<sub>0</sub>). 
      <br><br>
      If no 0's remain in the left part and the rightmost x is immediately followed by #, 
      the current configuration is in the form x<sup>m</sup>q<sub>0</sub>#x<sup>m</sup>0<sup>n&minus;m</sup>, n&minus;m &ge; 0, provided
      the input is in the form 0<sup>m</sup>#0<sup>n</sup>, m &le; n.
      Enter q<sub>5</sub> and check the string is actually in this form without extra #'s, and accept.
      This last checking will reject inputs like ##, 0#0#, 0#00##, etc. 
      <br><br>
      Otherwise, go to step 1 and repeat.

<br>

 <ol type=a>
 <li>Show the transition sequence on each of the following inputs:
  <ol type=i>
  <li>#
  <li>#0
  <li>00#0
  <li>00#00
  </ol>

 <li>Analyze the worst-case time complexity function of the above DTM and express it in O(f(n)) asymptotic notation
     where n is the length of the input string.
 </ol>

<br>
 
<li>
Consider the NTM in
<a href="sp12-assign-1-sol.html">Question 3 here</a>.

<br><br>

 <ol type=a>
  <li>Give the exact number of branches of the computation tree on input string
      0<sup>n</sup>, n &ge; 0.
      Justify your answer.
  <li>Give the exact worst-case time complexity function, W<sub>M</sub>(n), of this NTM.
      Justify your answer.
  <li>Modify this NTM to one which, given an input 0<sup>n</sup> (n &ge; 0), nondeterministically writes a string x
      &isin; {a<sub>1</sub>, &hellip;, a<sub>k</sub>}<sup>*</sup> such that 0 &le; |x| &le; n. </ol>

<br>

<li>
<ol type=a>
<li>
In sufficient detail, concisely describe a 3-tape DTM that computes &lfloor;m&thinsp;/&thinsp;n&rfloor; where m, n are non-negative
integers in unary notation.
The values of m, n are initially placed on tape 1, 2 respectively, and
the value of &lfloor;m&thinsp;/&thinsp;n&rfloor; is to be written on tape 3.
No need to give a transition function/diagram.
<li>
Illustrate the operation of your DTM by examples of &lfloor;8&thinsp;/&thinsp;4&rfloor; and &lfloor;10&thinsp;/&thinsp;4&rfloor;.
<li>
Analyze the worst-case time complexity function of your DTM in terms of k = m + n and 
express it in O(f(k)) asymptotic notation.
</ol>

<br>

<li>
This question is about the simulation of multi-tape DTMs by 1-tape DTMs.
Consider the following configuration of a 3-tape DTM with &Gamma; = {a, b, c, _}:

<center><img src="assign-1-Q4.jpg" width=550 height=330></center>

 <ol type=a>
 <li>Give the 1-tape DTM configuration simulating the above configuration.
 <li>Give the 1-tape DTM configuration simulating the configuration obtained by
     the 3-tape DTM transition
     &delta;(q<sub>i</sub>, b, c, c) = (q<sub>j</sub>, a, b, a, L, R, R) from the above configuration.
 </ol>
 
<br>

<li>
Recall the simulation of DTMs by RAMs described in class.

<br><br>

 <ol type=a>
 <li>Give the RAM memory configuration simulating
     a<sub>3</sub>a<sub>1</sub>a<sub>4</sub>q<sub>3</sub>a<sub>5</sub>a<sub>2</sub>a<sub>3</sub>.
 <li>Give the RAM memory configuration simulating the configuration obtained by the transition
     &delta;(q<sub>3</sub>, a<sub>5</sub>) = (q<sub>2</sub>, a<sub>2</sub>, L) from the above configuration.
 </ol>

<br>

<li>
Recall the simulation of RAMs by multi-tape DTMs described in class.
Show the contents of tape 1 (simulating the RAM memory) and tape 2 (simulating the accumulator r<sub>0</sub>) after
the execution of each instruction in the following RAM program:

<br><br>

Load =3<br>
Store 3<br>
Add 3<br>
Store 2<br>
Sub =2<br>
Store 1<br>
Mult 3<br>
Store 2

<br><br>

Presume that tape 1 is initially empty.
Use a format similar to
<a href="fa12-assign-1-sol.html">Question 5 on this page</a>, and
abbreviate integers in unary notation to decimal notation.

<br><br>

<li>
A DTM with a <i>bidirectionally infinite tape</i> is identical to the DTMs 
with unidirectionally infinite tapes we defined and studied, except that
its tape extends infinitely in both left and right directions.
Initially, the input string is placed in a segment of the tape and the tape head is reading
the leftmost symbol of the input.
Informally but in sufficient detail,
describe how to simulate such a DTM by a DTM with a unidirectionally infinite tape.
